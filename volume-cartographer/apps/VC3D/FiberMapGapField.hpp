// The Fiber Map's gap heat map: for every cell of the global map's extent, a
// surrogate for the shortest distance from that spot on the sheet to any
// drawn fiber, counting fibers on neighbouring windings.
//
// The global map draws fibers at x = (s*theta + 2*pi*k) * rRef, y = z, so one
// winding is exactly one period P = 2*pi*rRef of x, and "the same angle on the
// winding k away" is the map position x + k*P. GlobalResult also carries the
// Archimedean sheet model r(W) = radius0 + pitch*W with sheetDistanceVx(), a
// monotonic warp u(x) in which a horizontal step is arclength (the integral of
// r dtheta) rather than the map's rRef-scaled angle. The field is
//
//     D(cell) = min over k of  sqrt( S_k^2 + (|k| * acrossWeight * pitch)^2 )
//
// where S_k is the distance, in (u, z), from the cell's position shifted k
// periods to the nearest rasterised fiber, and |k|*pitch is the modelled radial
// separation of k sheets. acrossWeight = 1 reads as the model's own radial
// spacing; larger values push the field toward per-winding coverage (only a
// fiber on the cell's own winding counts). acrossWeight == 0, or a degenerate
// sheet model (pitch 0), disables the fold: D = S_0, and `folded` is false.
//
// With `fade` on, a fiber's influence also tapers with the winding gap and is
// gone at `fadeWindings`: the candidate from winding k is blended toward the
// saturation by |k| / fadeWindings,
//
//     D_k' = (1 - |k|/N) * D_k + (|k|/N) * saturationVx,     N = fadeWindings,
//
// so the cell's own winding counts in full, winding N-1 barely, and winding N
// and beyond not at all (they are never searched). This is a display choice
// on top of the metric, for maps where a fiber several sheets away should not
// read as covering a gap.
//
// What this is and is not. It is one number per cell, in voxels, exact up to
// the rasterisation (fibers are drawn one cell wide, distances are read from
// an exact per-cell Euclidean distance transform and interpolated between
// columns) and clamped at `saturationVx`. It is NOT a 3D chord distance: the in-sheet part is
// arclength of r dtheta (not of the spiral's true arc), the radial part is the
// global linear model's spacing (not the local one), and S_k is measured at the
// arc scale of the winding the query lands on rather than the cell's own,
// which overstates by about |k|*pitch/r. Cells where the model's radius is not
// positive have no meaningful sheet position and read NaN.
//
// Coverage is the layout's padded extent (x0Vx..x1Vx, yMinVx..yMaxVx), not the
// scroll's full height. Seeds are the runs of every placed fiber whose anchor
// is resolved (GlobalAnchor::Unresolved fibers sit at an arbitrary winding and
// never seed); runs shorter than two points are not drawn and do not seed
// either; interpolated runs seed only when `seedInterpolated`.
//
// Everything here is voxels, like the layout; the intents behind the defaults
// are noted per field at 2.4 um/voxel. Deterministic: every cell is a pure
// function of its own inputs, so the thread count never changes the output.

// at its centre, which can be far lower where the fold's other-winding
// candidates slope steeply; the source's own raster error is carried over),

// windings stretch the map; the source's own resolution, cell * r(W) / rRef
// in sheet distance, is all there is). Right for a heat map that shows where
