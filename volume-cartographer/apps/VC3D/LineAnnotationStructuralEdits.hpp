// Pure planning of the structural fiber edits (merge two fibers into one,
// split one into two) on stored records, free of the controller and of Qt,
// so the outcome that gets written to disk can be unit-tested against the
// loader's own link checks.
//
// The controller's job is reduced to: pick the participants, run the
// planner, redirect the peers' refs with redirectBranchRefs, run the batch
// through canonicalizeFiberSaveSnapshots + validateFiberSaveSnapshots and
// checkStructuralEditGraph, and commit it with ONE runFiberSaveJob (new
// files + redirected peers as payloads, originals as retirements).
