// Global winding assignment for unrolled fibers, from H-vs-V crossing evidence.
//
// Every fiber arrives with its unwrapped angle theta about the umbilicus (own
// arbitrary 2*pi gauge), radius and z per sample. The solver assigns each fiber
// an integer turn offset k so that the winding coordinate
//
//     W = s * theta / (2*pi) + k        (s = global chirality sign)
//
// is consistent across fibers. The evidence, in order of authority:
//
//  - Papyrus structure: horizontal fibers lie on the front of the sheet,
//    verticals behind, so an H fiber on the SAME winding as a V fiber passes
//    between that V fiber and the umbilicus. An H fiber crossing a V fiber's
//    angular position *inside* it (dr <= 0) is therefore on the same winding
//    or further inward (W_h <= W_v, weak); crossing *outside* (dr > 0) means
//    strictly outward (W_h >= W_v + 1). The sign of dr is the whole
//    classification - there is no same-winding tie equality, because on a
//    tightly wound scroll the wrap spacing is only a few sheet thicknesses,
//    and a dr-band equality manufactures constraints out of sub-band radial
//    noise. The weak inside form absorbs same-winding contacts at equality;
//    a contact whose noise flips the sign costs a winding of separation,
//    accepted rather than guessed away.
//  - Links: annotated ties between two fibers' control points - the same
//    winding, or with LinkInput::windingOffset an adjacent one -
//    an integer equality on k with confidence from the angular residual.
//  - Local radial ordering: along any ray from the umbilicus the windings stay
//    radially ordered even when crumpling destroys their spacing. This never
//    forms a constraint; it breaks the gauge freedom the constraints leave
//    (slack nodes, islands).
//
// Crossings are detected as transversal intersections of the two polylines in
// (theta, z) surface coordinates over every 2*pi translate that can meet the V
// fiber's lift, so the integer turn gap n at a crossing is exact by
// construction; there is no angular residual to round. (Links do carry a real
// residual - their endpoints are separately annotated - which is why they have
// a residual-based confidence and crossings do not.)
//
// All constraints are integer difference constraints k_u - k_w >= c.
// Infeasibility is a positive-weight cycle; repair removes, per detected
// cycle, the constraint with the lowest confidence / (1 + times already seen
// in a cycle) - the discount is what lets a wrong link (whose residual, and
// hence confidence, looks clean) lose to several correct crossings instead of
// eliminating them one by one. Every dropped constraint is reported.
//
// The feasible solution is packed densest from below (longest-path
// tightening), then nodes with slack take the value in their feasible interval
// that best matches local radial ordering. Components unreachable from the
// primary component through constraints are anchored rigidly by the same
// ordinal cost, largest first; components with no anchored neighbours at all
// are reported unresolved rather than guessed.
