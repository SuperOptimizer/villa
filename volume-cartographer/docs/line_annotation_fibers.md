# VC3D Line Annotation Fibers

## CP direction annotations

Shift-drag near an existing CP in either strip to edit its forward direction.
The live cyan handle points from the CP to the cursor; release commits, Escape
cancels. The local strip frame includes normal corrections. Editing preserves
the component perpendicular to that strip and changes only the in-plane heading.
A click without movement does not change the annotation.
Away from a CP, a completed drag inserts a CP at the drag-start volume point.
It inherits the interpolated normal correction through ordinary CP placement;
the direction is applied before the edit is published or optimization scheduled.
Escape cancels creation as well as direction editing.
Annotated CPs have a cyan 80-pixel direction marker in both strips (hover edge
ticks are 12 pixels). Markers and dragging share the corrected local strip frame.
The bottom of the Ctrl-right-click menu offers "Clear CP normals and dirs"
for the selected CP. The annotation window menu offers "Clear all normals and dirs"
for the entire current fiber. Both clear manual and inherited normal corrections
and direction axes, but leaves fiber width/gap unchanged. Removing direction
constraints queues reoptimization of the affected adjacent spans using the current auto/manual mode.

The optional CP field `direction: [x,y,z]` is a finite nonzero signed forward
direction in base coordinates. Placement chooses its sign from increasing
strip-column/fiber order, not the user's drag sign. Reversal negates it;
save/load and remote merge preserve its sign. Opposite signed edits conflict.

Annotations apply independently of span length and interpolation choice:
native tracing fixes its first step to the annotation for forward tracing and
its negation for backward tracing (by fiber order, not endpoint displacement).
Ordinary initial-direction hints still select/sign-align the prediction. After
the fixed first step, ordinary candidate search resumes. For annotated endpoints
only, fusion restores the endpoint edge direction and smoothly fades the
positional adjustment into the interior;
Lasagna uses per-side endpoint direction constraints; cubic spline runs use
annotated endpoint and interior tangents. At the CP, the annotation also defines
the cross-section plane normal. Existing auto/manual optimization scheduling is
retained; edits dirty adjacent spans and connected spline runs follow the normal
optimization path. Saved display-normal corrections remain separate.

VC3D writes line annotations as `vc3d_fiber` JSON, currently **version 4**.
Version 3 stores `control_points` as objects with a required `position`. Every
non-final control point owns a required `segment_to_next` descriptor for its
span to control point `i+1`; the final control point cannot contain
`segment_to_next`. Version 4 is version 3 plus an optional `tags` array of
strings on each span descriptor, written only when non-empty, so a span
without tags serializes exactly as in version 3. A version-3 span carrying
`tags` is rejected, so the version is a true signal of what a file may
contain. Every loader (the core strict loader, VC3D, the python format
package, `fiber_merge`) accepts versions 1, 3 and 4; VC3D writes 4, and so
does the lasagna line probe for a re-optimized result (its plain `--output`
copy still copies the validated input as-is, whatever its version). The merge tool treats 3 and 4 as one lineage (a v3 base
with v4 sides is the normal state after an upgrade, not a conflict) and
writes the merge as version 4 when any side is 4. Builds older than version 4
refuse to load a version-4 file. A control point
may also carry an optional `tags` array of strings, written only when non-empty;
the one tag today is `kollesis_termination`, set from the control point's
Ctrl+right-click menu ("Kollesis termination", a toggle) to mark where the fiber
ends at a kollesis. Only the first or last control point can take it (the menu
item is disabled elsewhere, except to remove a tag an edited file put on an
interior point). While an end is tagged, no control point can be placed beyond
it: the click, the `/` and `0` keys and the current-position marker all treat
that region as blocked (red marker), and a merge whose join side is a tagged end
is refused. Remove the tag to extend or merge. The toggle itself is refused
while a solve is running or pending for the session (its rollback would
restore the pre-edit points). The extrapolated tail still draws past a tagged
end. Tags belong to the point, not its span: they survive a
click that replaces the point, a split, a reverse and a merge (union of both
points' tags), and go with a deleted point. Loaders reject any other
control-point field, so a tagged fiber does not load on builds older than this
field.

## Fiber width and display normals

Adding a CP inside a manually corrected region inherits the effective
interpolated display normal before insertion, rather than adding a zero-offset
knot. Existing CP replacements keep their stored normal; explicit edge-drag
normals take precedence. Uncorrected regions remain unset and follow Lasagna.

In the upper-left cross view, Shift-left-drag selects the closest of the
center and two nominal width edges (not the tolerance boundaries), in screen
space. Moving the center translates it without editing its normal or width.
Moving an edge places it at the mouse, using the direction from the original
opposite edge to determine orientation. Width stays fixed: the center sits half
the width behind the mouse along that direction, and the opposite edge moves
with it. Only the CP position and baked display normal change. With no width,
only the center is draggable. While Shift remains held, mouse release retains
the preview and another drag continues from it without reslicing or optimizing.
Releasing Shift commits one combined edit using the ordinary CP replacement
radius, save and reoptimization path (if the mouse is still down, commit waits
for its release). The original line anchor is retained across all strokes. Escape,
focus loss or a geometry replacement cancels it. A target exactly at the original
opposite edge cannot define an angle, so that stroke is discarded while earlier
strokes are retained. This replaces prediction
snap Shift-click in this cross view only. Fiber storage and tracing-normal
semantics are unchanged.

The drag preview also shows both inner/outer tolerance ticks, using the stored
width gap and following the preview's position and rotation. These ticks are
12 screen pixels long and respect the width-guide visibility toggle.
During the Shift-drag sequence, the original normal/width guides and ordinary
hover-width markers are hidden; only the current drag preview is shown. They
return on commit or cancellation, respecting their menu visibility settings.

The annotation toolbar has **Fiber width** (base voxels; 0 means unset) and
**CP angle offset** (degrees). The angle control selects the nearest CP within
the same arclength radius as CP replacement, and is disabled outside that radius.
Setting an angle to zero removes its manual normal.

Version-3 JSON stores optional top-level `width`, always-written top-level
`width_gap_fraction` (default 0.2), and optional per-control-point
`display_normal: [x,y,z]` and `display_normal_source`. The source is `manual`
for explicit angle/edge-drag edits, `interpolated` for inheritance on CP
creation, and `unknown` for older normals without provenance. Training should
select only `manual`. Normal and provenance travel together through saving,
replacement, reversal, split/merge, optimization and remote three-way sync.
Clearing a normal omits both fields. The normal is the baked world-space unit normal,
not an angle. The gap is a dimensionless fraction between 0 and 1; missing
values load as 0.2 and are explicitly written on the next save. Existing values
are retained; there is currently no gap editor in the toolbar. Coordinates
scale the width but never this fraction. The stored normal is projected into
the current cross plane after movement,
reoptimization, or Lasagna reload; the spinbox shows its angle relative to the
current Lasagna normal. An unprojectable stored direction is cleared, saved,
and reported with the number of affected CPs.

Display offsets use bounded C1 smoothstep interpolation in arclength between
CPs (shortest angular path). Unset CPs constrain the offset to zero. The viewer
and annotation code share the cut-plane tangent calculation. Corrections affect
the cross-section and both strips, never tracing, alignment metrics, or
optimization inputs.

Width draws inner and outer guide pairs at `(1-gap)*width` and
`(1+gap)*width`: by default 80% and 120% of the full width
(offsets +/-0.40 and +/-0.60 times width from the center). The top strip shows
continuous boundaries; the cross view shows short ticks. Hovering either view
shows cyan edge ticks in both panes around the same world-space hover position,
projected into each view, to preview placement. Cursor ticks
remain 12 screen pixels long; their spacing follows the physical width and
view scale. They hide on leaving the view, invalid data, unset width or hiding
width guides, independently of linked-cursor mirroring.
Any manual normal enables a horizontal cross-view guide. Both guide types can
be hidden in the annotation menu. Graphics items are reused; width paths change
only when the width changes (short tick lengths also adapt on zoom), with
transforms updated for navigation. Mouse movement only repositions the existing
cursor overlay, without requesting a volume render.

**Ctrl+Space** in the fiber annotation window toggles the existing volume
overlay through the main window's shared toggle action. **Space** continues to
toggle cross-view mouse-follow. The annotation menu also exposes the overlay
toggle. This is independent of width/normal guide visibility.

Edits use the ordinary queued fiber save/sync path without retracing or changing
review tags. CP metadata follows CP movement, reversal and split; each split
inherits width and gap. Joining fibers uses the clicked fiber's nonzero width
and its gap, otherwise the other fiber's width and gap. Three-way sync merges
width, gap and per-CP normal changes
independently of span refits; divergent edits and edits to removed CPs conflict.

The former cross-section polygon/line editor and `cross_sections` storage are
removed. Old records are not migrated and are omitted when rewriting a fiber.

Tagged points draw as a hollow ring in the control-point yellow, a step larger
than a filled point, in the cut and strip views and the overview bar; a tagged
point that is also linked keeps the link-state fill inside the yellow ring. The
Fiber Map marks every tagged point of every fiber the same way, selected or not.

The second control-point tag is `break`, set from the same Ctrl+right-click
menu ("Break", a toggle), on any control point: the point sits at the edge of
a break in the papyrus. A point carries `kollesis_termination` or `break`,
never both: the menu disables adding the second (removing either is always
possible), the handlers refuse it, also when another pane of the same fiber
has the other tag on that point, and a click that would collapse a break
point with a termination is refused rather than dropping a tag.

Two consecutive break points (neighbours in line-position order) make the
span between them a **gap span**, and VC3D records that on the span itself:
the span's `segment_to_next.tags` carries `gap` (the one span tag today). A
reader of the file learns the gap from the span alone, without inferring it
from neighbouring points, and everything in VC3D that shows or enforces a gap
reads the span tag: the dotted amber line, the placement block, the goal
change and the Fiber Map runs. Only the dotted rings read the point tags. VC3D
keeps the two in step: the span tags are recomputed from the break tags after
the toggle, after every structural edit (click collapse, delete, solve
landing, superseded-solve merge) and in every file it writes, and a loaded
file whose span tags disagree with its break tags (a version-3 file, or a
hand edit) is healed on load and saved back as version 4 under the same
stale-file guard as the adjacent-link heal. Every pair of consecutive break
points is therefore a gap; to keep a span between two breaks open, place
another control point between them.

A gap span is closed to placement: the click, the `/` and `0` keys and the
current-position marker (cut views, strips, overview bar and the
intersection-inspection panes) treat any line position strictly inside it as
blocked (red marker) until one of the breaks is removed. A break is refused
at or immediately next to a kollesis termination (line-order neighbours), from
the point menu and the span menu alike, so the span next to a sheet join can
never become a gap. When a gap span
forms, its `interp_goal` becomes `cspline` and the span is re-solved (the
toggle through the same path as the menu's "Interpolation goal", a structural
edit within the solve it starts anyway), so the line bridges the break as a
spline instead of a trace hunting for fiber signal across it; when a gap span
dissolves while its goal is still `cspline`, the goal returns to `global`
(any other goal is left alone). Span tags survive a re-solve like the goal
does: the tracer rebuilds the descriptor and copies them back, and the
lasagna line probe carries them through a re-optimization. The span label in
the cut views appends "gap" to the mode marker so the span metadata can be
read as text.

Break points draw as a dotted ring in the break amber (255, 196, 0), one
step larger than a filled point, in the cut and strip views, the overview
bar and the Fiber Map (a linked break keeps its link-state fill inside the
ring). A gap span draws as a dashed pastel-red line (235, 120, 120) in place of the
fiber's own line in the side cut, the strips and the overview bar; linked and nearby
fibers keep their solid purple line. The Fiber Map draws every fiber's gap
spans as dotted pastel-red runs trimmed exactly to the two control points at draw
time (the layout's own run geometry, which seeds the gap heat map, is
unchanged), in place of the traced or interpolated style, and marks every
break point with the dotted amber rim. The flag is display-only in the map:
it does not change heat-map seeding, winding evidence or publishing.

## Combined span and control-point menu (strips)

In either strip view, Ctrl+right-click anywhere across its height opens one
menu with actions for the containing span and the nearest control point.
Span selection uses only the click's longitudinal line position, not its
distance from the centre line or a CP marker. At an exact CP position the
outgoing span is selected; the final CP uses its incoming span. Extrapolated
tails outside the control-point range have CP actions only.
The menu identifies both targets and shows the span's state (mode marker,
goal, gap or damaged). The span section contains:

- **Interpolation goal** (Global / Cubic spline / Lasagna / Fiber trace):
  lives here and nowhere else now.
- **Gap** (toggle): tags both ends as breaks, which makes the span a gap
  through the usual sync and goal policy; refused at or next to a kollesis
  termination. Unchecking removes the break only from ends no other gap span
  depends on. Making a span a gap clears its damaged tag.
- **Damaged** (toggle): the span tag `damaged`; the line is correct but the
  papyrus there is damaged. Changes nothing about the points, the goal or the
  geometry. Never on a gap span. Drawn like a gap span, dashed, but in a
  pastel pink (255, 170, 205) where the gap line is a pastel red (235, 120,
  120), in the side cut, the strips, the overview bar and the Fiber Map; the
  span label appends "damaged".
- **Split, different windings** and **Split and link, same winding**: remove
  the span. Both halves are saved as brand-new fibers with the
  reoptimization tag and their branch links remapped, the original is
  deleted and its workspace closes; nothing is reopened. The second variant
  also records a pending reciprocal link between the two new ends. Each half
  needs at least two control points. The split-candidate tooling (red
  candidate marker, "Designate as split candidate", "Split from candidate",
  "Split from candidate and link") is gone.

The top-level `optimization_mode` is either `lasagna` or
`native_fiber_trace3d`. It is required in version 3; only legacy version-1
files may omit it and default to `lasagna`. The mode
selects extrapolation and resolves CP spans whose persisted `interp_goal` is
`global`. A segment goal is `global`, `cspline`, `lasagna`, or `trace`; its
`interp_mode` is the actual producer of the stored geometry and is one of
`cspline`, `lasagna`, or `trace`. The actual mode is recomputed from the goal
whenever the span is dirty, so a previous fallback is retried rather than
treated as permanent. Newly created fibers default to `native_fiber_trace3d`;
the Lasagna default for older files with no mode remains unchanged. For a new
native-mode fiber with a selected or uniquely attached fiber-inference
dataset, seed placement first computes an internal Lasagna reference line and
then immediately replaces both open tails with the existing single-control-
point native extrapolator. The reference line is not displayed or saved as the
finished fiber. If no inference dataset is selected or uniquely attached,
seed creation remains Lasagna and does not open a dataset picker.

The fallback order is `trace -> lasagna -> cspline` or `lasagna -> cspline`.
For the Global goal only, a span shorter than the global mode's own minimum
selects `cspline` immediately: in trace mode 12 tracer steps
(`kMinimumTraceSteps * stepVoxels * traceToBaseScale`, 48 base voxels with the
default 4 vx step), in Lasagna mode two Lasagna segments
(`kMinimumLasagnaSegments * segmentLength`, about 63 base voxels with the
default discretization). A span exactly at the minimum still attempts the
mode (48.0 vx is traced, 47.9 vx is a spline). In trace mode a Global-goal
span whose trace is not accepted falls back
to Lasagna only when it is at least the Lasagna minimum long; a shorter one
goes straight to `cspline` (message `short span, trace -> cspline`, counted as
`cspline_fallback_segments`, the trace failure metadata kept on the span).
Explicit goals never use these shortcuts. The tracer's endpoint acceptance is
bounded per span to a quarter of the start-to-target distance
(`kEndpointAcceptSpanFraction`; a 50 vx span accepts an endpoint miss of at
most 12.5 vx, spans of 80 vx and more keep the configured 20 vx), so a short
accepted trace must actually reach its target. Adjacent cubic-spline spans are
interpolated jointly with exact CPs, shared internal tangents, and hard boundary
directions from neighboring stored geometry. The spline helper uses no normal
or prediction data.

Trace attempts remain per span. Lasagna candidate failure also demotes only
that span; other usable Lasagna spans continue into the protected joint Ceres
refinement. Trace and cubic-spline spans, plus untouched manual spans, are
fixed during that solve and provide hard endpoint directions. CP edits dirty
only adjacent spans and expand through connected cubic-spline runs. Changing
the global mode retries global goals while initially protecting explicit goals.
Ctrl-right-clicking a generated span opens a checked `Interpolation goal`
submenu for all four goals.

The generated annotation workspace places a compact full-width schematic map
below the toolbar, followed by the current/side cut views and two stacked
volume-rendered strips. The first rendered strip is `lineSurface`; the second
is `lineSideSlice`. The schematic map shows the whole line and control-point
positions, but does not replace either rendered view. Both rendered strips are
ordinary interactive viewers: they can be panned, zoomed, and scrolled, drive
the current cut from mouse position, accept control-point interactions, and
show the per-span status labels described below. Cameras and splitter sizes
survive generated-view updates.

The main window's **BBox** checkbox beneath **Focus** enables an annotation
focus region. The adjacent minimum and maximum fields use inclusive absolute
base-volume `x, y, z` coordinates. An unset box starts at the current volume
extent; edited coordinates are normalized and clamped to that extent. The box
is session-only, survives volume/channel changes in the current package, and is
cleared when the project is replaced or closed.

When enabled, ordinary plane views and all line-annotation cut/strip views show
the area outside the box at half brightness. The dimming is applied after base
and attached-volume composition and does not dim control markers. The main
segmentation surface view is not covered by this version of the feature.

New seeds, linked branch seeds, and control points must be inside the active
box. Existing controls remain valid outside it, so a saved seed-only fiber can
still be reopened after the box is enabled or moved. A trace or reoptimization
captures the box when it starts; later box changes do not cancel that work or
alter untouched fibers. After a solve, the path between the outer control
points is preserved even if it briefly leaves the box. Only open tails are
shortened: they retain the first sample outside the box as a small overshoot. A
lone outside control retains any connector that reaches the box and its in-box
run; if neither tail reaches the box, one neighboring line sample is kept so
the fiber remains valid. Manual/no-reoptimization edits use the same open-tail
rule.

The rendered strips are derived views, not stored line geometry. Their columns
retain every annotation control point and both line endpoints. The optimized
line points between adjacent controls define the polyline path but are not
mandatory columns. Each control-point span is resampled by polyline arclength
using the interval count whose physical spacing is closest to the
8-base-voxel along-line target; a short span remains one interval with both
controls unchanged. Explicit
support arclengths provide a bidirectional mapping that keeps control points,
span labels, hover positions, cut planes, and saved line positions in the
original fractional point-index coordinate. The strip grid always declares an
along-line scale of `1/8`, so a short physical control-point span expands to
one nominal display interval instead of changing the scale of the rest of the
strip. Both ribbons have a fixed seven-row cross grid at 32 voxels per row,
giving a 192-base-voxel first-to-last-row extent close to the previous typical
width without depending on optimized-line spacing. The along-line target and
the cross-row spacing are independent constants
(`kLineViewAlongSamplingDistanceBaseVoxels`, `kLineViewCrossRowSpacingBaseVoxels`).

Ribbons are ordinary QuadSurfaces constructed at the existing support spacing.
Construction resamples the stored polyline and transports/sign-aligns/roll-smooths
its frames. Corrected normals replace the display input normals before this
same pipeline; no separate rotation is applied to finished frames.
Rendering, depth normals, picking, intersections
and export all use the same support grid. No cubic strip upsampling or custom
render-time interpolation is used. CP editing and cross views share the regular
central-chord line tangent (one-sided at endpoints), interpolated between samples.
Centers remain linear and volume LOD is unchanged.

Saved display normals are axes: both signs describe the same cross-section.
Offsets choose the smallest rotation around the fiber (at most 90 degrees),
and target axes interpolate in a common parallel-transported reference frame,
not as corrections added to a rotating Lasagna baseline. Unset CPs target the
Lasagna normal; spans with no corrected endpoints retain their sampled normals.
The ordinary construction pipeline owns all subsequent alignment and smoothing.

CP movement uses a cubic displacement field over the original chord arclength.
It preserves the requested CP positions and only replaces the existing adjacent
spans. Stationary controls and the outer edit boundaries have zero displacement
derivative, avoiding the former triangular correction's sudden slope change.
The corrected curve is still stored as a resampled polyline. This change does
not smooth or otherwise alter native bidirectional trace fusion.

Clicking to place a control point uses optimized-polyline arclength in base
voxels. Every existing control within an inclusive 8-voxel radius (the strip's
along-line sampling distance) is collapsed into one control at the clicked
location. This keeps adjacent control spans from becoming shorter than the
generated strip's nominal sampling distance. Seed, surviving span policy, and
branch links follow the collapsed control.

With automatic reoptimization, VC3D prepares the edit before changing the live
session. The same local update is used for insertion, one-control replacement,
and collapse: it reconstructs the surviving spans on both sides of the clicked
control from that control's known line position, then starts full fiber
optimization from the updated line. A collapse that leaves only one control
reinitializes from the clicked point and derives its tangent from the known old-
line position. It does not locate that tangent by nearest 3-D distance, which
could select a neighboring winding. If local preparation fails, the prior line,
controls, branches, focus, and optimization status remain unchanged. Reciprocal
branch updates for a multi-control collapse are saved only after asynchronous
optimization and generated-view rebuilding succeed.

The independent **Max extrap CP dist** setting limits how far a new control may
be placed beyond the first or last control point. It is measured along the
optimized polyline in base-volume voxels from the relevant outer control. It
does not restrict insertion between existing controls, and `0` means unlimited.
The current-position marker shows allowed or blocked state using this same
base-voxel arclength calculation.

The current cut view draws its solid yellow control-point marker only while the
control point is inside the cut plane's thin slab, so fast panning would
otherwise skip past control points unseen. To keep them findable, the view also
always draws two parallax ghosts: a hollow dashed yellow ring for the nearest
control point behind the cursor and one for the nearest ahead. Each ghost sits
at its true in-plane landing spot shifted horizontally toward the side it will
arrive from: the ring for a control point ahead of the cursor (higher line
position) sits to the right, matching the strips where line position runs left
to right. The shift is proportional to the signed line-position delta over a
fixed 8 line-position slide range and is clamped at 35% of the visible view
width, and the ring brightens from a faint floor at or beyond that range to
nearly opaque as the delta closes. Ghosts only appear while the control point
is within ten times the solid-marker window (so they don't linger far from any
control point), fading out over the outer quarter of that distance. Because the
shift decays continuously to zero, the ghost converges on the solid marker as a
landing ring instead of popping into place.

The Left and Right arrow keys pan the current position between control points
with a smooth velocity ramp. A tap accelerates, brakes, and lands exactly on
the nearest control point in that direction; holding the key cruises straight
through the intermediate points at a constant speed and, when it is released,
decelerates onto the next control point ahead (never short of the one a tap
would have reached). Beyond the outermost control point the pan continues one
more hop, to the Max extrap CP distance allowance or the end of the extrapolated
line, whichever is shorter. The boundary is converted from base-voxel
arclength back into optimized-line position. Pressing the opposite arrow
mid-pan decelerates through zero and reverses. Up and Down scale the cruising
speed (default 96 base voxels of optimized-polyline arclength per second, the same
physical speed in 4 vx trace spans and ~32 vx cspline spans; shift+wheel in the
current cut and the Space snap use the same arclength unit, one strip column
(8 vx) per notch and a quarter column for the snap),
which is shown in a transient badge and remembered between sessions. A Left or
Right press pauses the mouse hover-follow exactly as the space bar does, so the
❚❚ badge appears; space (or a click in a strip or cut view) resumes hover-follow
and cancels the pan. While the keyboard is panning, the strips stay centered
on the current-position line and scroll underneath it.

Ctrl+Shift+wheel (Cmd+Shift+wheel on macOS) in the current cut slides the cut
plane straight ahead along its own normal instead of following the optimized
line: the plane travels the same arclength per notch that the green
current-position marker advances (8 base voxels times the slice step size), so
with an unrotated cut on a straight stretch of a correct model the two gestures
coincide, and where the model has curved away from the true fiber the plane
keeps going straight while the marker keeps counting along the line. The
direction is fixed at the first notch of the gesture. The side cut and strip
planes and cameras stay where they are; only the position markers move.
Release the modifiers and click on the fiber to place a control point at the
advanced line position with the clicked 3D location, which pulls the
extrapolation back on track. Any along-line navigation (plain Shift+wheel,
Left/Right, a strip click, strip hover while hover-follow is on, Space, B, the
rotation keys) snaps the plane back onto the model line and brings the side
cut up to the marker.

`/` and `0` both place a control point on the blue current-position dot in the
current cut, so points can be dropped without leaving the keyboard while
arrow-panning along the line. The key stops an active pan, because the
placement renumbers the line positions the pan is steering by, but unlike a
click in the cut view it leaves hover-follow exactly as it was rather than
resuming it; the panes then land on the new control point once the
re-optimized line arrives. It does nothing while the Max CP distance rule
blocks placement at the current position, and stays inert while a spinbox or
combo box has the keyboard.

The toolbar's hamburger menu owns Auto-reoptimize, Reinit reoptimization,
Show as mesh, the Lasagna/Fiber dataset submenus, embedded spinbox rows for
the initial centerline length and the base-voxel extrapolation distance,
Mirror cursor across panes, and Reset views. Mirror cursor across panes drives
the shared cursor cross between the four generated panes: on by default,
remembered between sessions, and independent of the global "Sync cursor across
views" setting, so unchecking it keeps the cross in the hovered pane even while
that global setting is on. The toolbar retains the fiber-global Lasagna/Fiber
model selector. Tag pills are edited directly from the same toolbar.

Switching the fiber-global mode asks for confirmation before it re-optimizes,
because the switch overwrites the current line: to Fiber model it re-traces
every global-goal span with model predictions; back to Lasagna it re-fits them.
Suppressed (agent-driven) sessions skip the prompt. Either direction also
strips the `reviewed` tag on the save that follows the successful
re-optimization, because the human verdict no longer covers the new geometry.

Review state is the ordinary free-form `reviewed` tag — there is no
specialized review mechanism. It is set and cleared through the generic tag
UI like any other tag: the fiber panel's tag checkboxes and the Line
Annotation toolbar's tag pills, where `reviewed` is pinned first and always
offered even in a volpkg where no fiber carries it yet. The only
programmatic change is the mode-switch strip described above; ordinary
control-point edits, merges, and splits never touch it, and
`scripts/fiber_merge.py` treats it as a plain tag under the usual
three-way tag merge. `scripts/vc_sync.py hfsync` publishes gated on it
(`reviewed` is its default `--tag`), so the tag doubles as the publish gate.

The fiber panel's `interp` column shows the interpolation provenance per
fiber — `legacy` (no trace spans), `predictions` (trace spans, native mode),
or `mixed` (trace spans under a lasagna-global fiber); the review state
itself is visible as an ordinary tag. Span child rows show the stored
producer marker `C`/`L`/`T`. Predictions provenance is the per-span
`segment_to_next.fiber_manifest` written at trace acceptance (the selected
fiber-inference manifest identity); the panel surfaces it as a tooltip on
the `interp` cells, and `fiber.list` over the agent bridge exposes the same
data as `traceState` and per-span `interpMode` plus `fiberManifest`.


Each direction continues until it reaches all target-local planes within the
20-base-voxel endpoint threshold or exhausts its step budget. VC3D then moves
locally tangent planes along both complete traces and intersects the opposite
trace. It selects the smallest meeting error and accepts it when the error is
at most `max(10 base voxels, 10% of the combined partial traced length)`. This
can succeed even when neither direction reached its endpoint planes. The
accepted partial traces are warped by arc-length fraction to a shared meeting
point. With prefix lengths `Lf`, `Lr` and meeting positions `Pf`, `Pr`, this is
`Pf + Lf/(Lf+Lr) * (Pr-Pf)`: each side absorbs correction proportional to its
traced length. A zero-length side stays at its CP and the other side takes the
full endpoint correction, without an artificial connector. This is shared by
all native segment-tracing callers. The partial traces are concatenated and
resampled, with the original CP endpoints restored
exactly. Rejected spans display the generic `fiber gap` failure label because
the threshold is no longer ratio-only.

Successful native spans are fixed
during the fallback solve. At each native-adjacent control point, VC3D derives
the tangent from the control point to the first distinct dense native point.
Lasagna geometry on the opposite side is hard-constrained to leave the control
point along the negative of that tangent. VC3D creates and fixes one adjacent
proxy point on that direction, then runs the ordinary Lasagna Ceres solve and
its existing smoothness terms for the remaining points. With one constrained
endpoint, that fiber direction is the span's only rollout candidate. With two,
one rollout is generated from each constrained endpoint. Reinitialization does
not submit the previous Lasagna span or its endpoint directions as candidates;
a direction propagated from an already solved neighbor also replaces generic
CP/chord initialization. Degenerate tangent-plane projection selects a
deterministic perpendicular tangent instead of continuing along the sampled
normal. This applies at both ends of a fallback span when it lies between
native spans.

Every segment descriptor stores a compact `msg` and an optional mode-dependent
`metric`: trace stores minimum meeting-plane error in base voxels, Lasagna
stores maximum normal-alignment error in degrees, and cubic spline stores no
metric. Detailed trace and Lasagna failures remain in their mode-specific
fields. `normal_manifest` stores the Lasagna manifest location used by the
span, and `fiber_manifest` stores the fiber-inference manifest location. A
direct Lasagna span stores only the former; trace stores both because it samples
Lasagna normals; direct cubic spline stores neither. Fallbacks retain the
locations consulted by failed higher-priority attempts.

For ordinary project datasets these values are the configured local or remote
manifest paths. The open-data catalogue has no artifact UUID: it identifies a
Lasagna artifact by public artifact URL plus sample ID, volume ID, coordinate
level, optional model ID, and manifest artifact index. Segment metadata stores
the reconstructed exact public manifest URL, never its local cache path.

Strip labels prefix the actual mode as `C`, `L`, or `T`, then display
the metric and message. Labels are laid out in viewport pixels, remain visible
while any part of their span intersects the view, and use a deterministic
second row when one row cannot avoid overlap. Legacy version-1 fibers remain
readable and acquire explicit version-3 descriptors on the next save. The
unpublished file version 2 and its pre-v3 descriptor schemas are unsupported.
This does not affect the current `tracer_version: 2` stored inside a version-3
segment descriptor.

All v3 readers validate this complete contract before using even geometry-only
data. VC3D, native CLI tools, Atlas, Lasagna, Spiral, Python training loaders,
and sync reject a missing mode, a missing non-final descriptor, a descriptor on
the final CP, malformed config, or inconsistent mode diagnostics. They never
repair, normalize, tag, or rewrite invalid v3 input. Sync routes it to the
manual conflict workflow and keeps local, remote, and base files unchanged.

## Sync Conflict Handling

`scripts/vc_sync.py` compares local and S3 content with the last successfully
synced shadow copy. When both versions changed, `scripts/fiber_merge.py`
performs a three-way merge. Version-3 fibers are divided into complete stored
span results: each result contains its dense CP-to-CP line slice and the
starting CP's complete `segment_to_next` descriptor. Geometry and metadata are
never merged field by field or selected by generation.

A span run changed on only one side is retained verbatim, and identical
two-sided results converge. Separate local and remote changes can be combined
only when at least one complete base span between them is unchanged on both
sides. Adjacent edits, different edits to the same run, overlapping topology
changes, missing ordered CP/line anchors, and inexact joins are conflicts.
`optimization_mode` follows the same base-aware policy: one changed side wins,
equal changes converge, and different two-sided changes conflict.

An ambiguous merge does not modify the fiber. The sync tool stores local,
remote, and base copies under `.s3sync-conflicts/` and asks whether to keep the
complete local version, keep the complete remote version, or skip. Those
questions are asked before the link-consistency planning of the other
conflicts: a decided file ([l]ocal or [r]emote) is a known source the planner
can plan its linked neighbours against, so their auto-merges land in the same
run; only a skipped file blocks the neighbours that depend on it, which are
then asked about in turn. A merge that dropped its link to a peer deleted on
both sides (or pending local deletion) needs no reciprocal fix and is not
treated as a dangling link. `--dry-run` reports content-merge eligibility only;
link consistency is assessed in a real run. Existing
base-aware tag, branch-link, reciprocal-peer, and manual-HV-tag handling runs
only after geometry merges cleanly. Version-1 fibers retain the older merge
behavior, including the CP-polyline `needs_reoptimization`
fallback for disjoint geometry edits.

`vc_lasagna_line_probe --reopt` and `--reinit-reopt` write a coherent new v3
Lasagna result: exact CP positions and existing goals are retained, actual span
modes become `lasagna`, the input normal manifest and per-span maximum normal
alignment error are recorded, trace-only diagnostics are cleared, and geometry
and descriptors receive one generation update. The probe validates this result
before atomically replacing its output. Without either optimization flag,
`--output` copies the validated input without inventing new producer metadata.

The line-annotation extrapolation control is in base voxels. Lasagna mode grows
normal-based tails. Native mode attempts each tail with the shared one-way
fiber tracer after converting the requested distance to trace voxels. That
distance defines `ceil(distance / nominal step)` generations: extrapolation
uses no target planes, ignores `max_step_factor`, and uses the remaining nominal
distance for its final generation. Completing the planned generations is
success; accumulated measured arc length is not consulted.
Stored line and control points always remain in base coordinates. When the
prediction field returns no valid next direction at a volume edge, the tracer
retains its last valid partial path and VC3D stops the native tail there. A
failure before the first outward step keeps the Lasagna fallback. A retained
Lasagna tail adjacent to a successful native span uses the same hard
continuation direction. Each retained fallback emits a terminal warning
containing `side`, the full `reason`, `trace_points`, and `source`
(`trace_result` or `exception`). Completed length-based tails and accepted
data-edge truncation do not emit this warning.
