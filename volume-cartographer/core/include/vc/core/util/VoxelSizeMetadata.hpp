// Voxel size, in micrometers, from a volume store's own sidecar document: the
// parsed contents of `meta.json` or `metadata.json`, exactly as published and
// before any key flattening.
//
// Each recognized schema is matched by its exact path. These documents also
// record unrelated scales (a segmentation mask downsample, a crop range), and a
// search for any key that merely looks like a resolution finds those too.
//
// Recognized, in order:
//   * a top-level `voxelsize` (this codebase's own field, micrometers), or one
//     of the `voxel_size_um` / `voxelSizeUm` / `pixel_size_um` / `pixelSizeUm`
//     / `resolution_um` spellings. Only at the top level, where the field
//     describes this volume: the same names nested under `metadata` on a
//     derived store belong to its *source* volume, at an unstated pyramid
//     level.
//   * `scan.voxelsize` -- the legacy top-level `voxelsize` shape nested under a
//     `scan` wrapper. Micrometers, like the top-level field it mirrors; see the
//     definition for why that unit is not a guess. Matched at that exact path
//     only, and deliberately WITHOUT a `tomo` guard: the pre-patch renderer's
//     reader had no acquisition-record branch, so a document carrying both
//     `scan.voxelsize` and `scan.tomo.acquisition.detector.samplePixelSize`
//     resolved to `scan.voxelsize`, and it still does. This is the second
//     candidate of that reader, and it comes before the acquisition record
//     here for the same reason.
//   * `scan.tomo.acquisition.detector.samplePixelSize`  -- ESRF/BM18 scan record
//   * `tomo.acquisition.detector.samplePixelSize`       -- the same record at the
//                                                document root, as the fused
//                                                mosaic exports write it
//   * the two acquisition-record paths above under `source.metadata`, for a
//     derived store (surface or ink prediction), scaled by 2^`source.resolution`
//     because inference runs on a downscaled level of its source volume.
//     `source.resolution` is required, not defaulted: without it the factor is
//     unknown, and a voxel size wrong by an unstated power of two is worse than
//     none.
//
// Effective precedence, which is the historical order for every document shape
// the pre-patch reader could read, extended for derived stores:
//
//     top-level `voxelsize`  >  `scan.voxelsize`  >  acquisition record  >  source
//
// `samplePixelSize` is in millimeters in all of these.

// voxelSizeFromStoreMetadata() over a local volume store: its `meta.json`,

// Volume, so they agree with Volume::voxelSize() on what the store says. Never
// throws; a missing or malformed document resolves nothing.
//
// A candidate that yields no usable voxel size does not end the search: a
// `meta.json` holding only dimensions, or one that will not parse at all, falls
// through to `metadata.json`. Treating "no usable size here" as "no usable size
// in this store" is what made some local inputs lose their physical scale
// entirely.
