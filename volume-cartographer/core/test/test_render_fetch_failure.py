"""CLI regressions for a remote chunk fetch that fails; no downloads, no third-party packages.

Run with: python test_render_fetch_failure.py /path/to/vc_render_tifxyz

Everything the renderer reads is built in a temporary directory: a small synthetic OME-Zarr volume
whose chunk bytes are generated on demand, and a flat tifxyz surface inside it. An HTTP server serves
the volume and decides, per request, whether to answer. Six cases:

  every fetch fails      the run must stop with exit code 1 rather than a core dump (#1809), and
                         the TIFF it leaves behind must not contain an image
  the zarr output path   the same, in the other output mode, where the leftover is metadata with no
                         chunks: a reader gets fill_value everywhere, so the exit code is the only
                         signal a caller gets
  transient failures     the retry path must still recover, exit 0, and produce bytes identical to a
                         run against a server that never fails
  a failure partway      one chunk column is served and the next refused, so the failure lands inside
                         the sampling loop, which is the situation #1809 describes
  the error message      one line naming the chunk and the HTTP status, exit code 1, and no sign of
                         the abort path, for both zarr chunk-key styles
  a working render       a guard: a run against a server that answers everything must come back with
                         real voxels in it, or every case above would pass without rendering anything

Standard library only: it writes the surface TIFFs and reads back the leftover TIFF itself, so there
is nothing to install, nothing to skip over, and it runs on any machine that can build the renderer.
About fifteen seconds.
