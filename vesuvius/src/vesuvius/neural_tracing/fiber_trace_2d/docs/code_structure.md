# 2D Fiber Trace Loader Code Structure

This package implements a loader/debug runner and training path for 2D fiber
side-strip patches around VC3D fiber control points.

The sibling package `vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_3d` implements the
CP-centered 3D model path. It shares fiber JSON/NML parsing conventions,
Lasagna-manifest dataset semantics, and the shared Lasagna tiled inference
machinery with this package, but it does not use 2D side/top strip input
loading.

## 3D CP Model Package

`fiber_trace_3d/direction.py`

- Implements Lasagna's 3D direction target layout as three ambiguous 2D
  double-angle projection pairs:
  `dir0_z,dir1_z`, `dir0_y,dir1_y`, and `dir0_x,dir1_x`.
- Decodes Lasagna 3x2 predictions analytically by decoding each two-channel
  projection with `theta = atan2(sin2theta, cos2theta) / 2` and applying the
  Lasagna three-plane reconstruction/sign-alignment logic. There is no
  unit-sphere candidate or grid-search decode path.
- Provides projection-magnitude weights for directions that are nearly
  degenerate in one projection plane.

`fiber_trace_3d/model.py`

- Wraps `Vesuvius3dUnetModel` either as a legacy grouped-output model or as
  the active direction-conditioned model.
- In conditioned mode, the shared 3D U-Net emits a configurable latent feature
  volume (`model_3d.conditioned_latent_channels`, default `64`) independent of
  the U-Net starting width. A pointwise decoder head receives latent channels
  plus a six-channel Lasagna 3x2 query and emits seven sigmoid channels: six
  direction channels and one sheet/fiber presence channel.
- The conditioned decoder head is only `1x1x1` convolutions/ReLU layers. The
  all-zero query is reserved as an off-manifold unconditioned token.
- `forward(volume)` returns the zero-query output for compatibility.
  `forward_recurrent_grouped(volume, steps=2)` returns branch-shaped grouped
  outputs: zero-query first, then recurrent outputs conditioned on the previous
  decoded direction.
- Legacy configs still use grouped direction/presence output branches. Branch 0
  preserves the legacy channel layout (`0:6` direction, `6` presence).
- `direction_outputs(...)` returns `B,K,6,D,H,W` and `presence_outputs(...)`
  returns `B,K,1,D,H,W`; the older `direction_output(...)` and
  `presence_output(...)` wrappers return the first seven-channel prediction.
- Config derives `features_per_stage`, `unet_base_channels`, `unet_depth`,
  `strides`, and `decoder_upsample_mode` the same way as the existing 3D fiber
  model helpers.
- The fiber 3D wrapper defaults to `BatchNorm3d` normalization. The trainer has
  no internal micro-batching, so the configured `batch_size` is the real batch
  used for BatchNorm statistics. Set `model_3d.normalization: "none"` to disable
  normalization explicitly.

`fiber_trace_3d/inference_adapter.py`

- Adapts trained 3D fiber models to the shared tiled 3D inference layer in
  `lasagna.tiled_predict3d`.
- Loads models through `build_fiber_trace_3d_model(...)`, restores snapshots
  with the same training helper used by `train.py`, applies the configured
  fiber image normalization per tile, and uses the training mixed-precision
  autocast settings when available.
- If the checkpoint contains the training `config`, the adapter uses that
  snapshot config for model construction, output option count, and tile
  preprocessing. This prevents a current CLI/config file from accidentally
  constructing a conditioned-decoder model for an older free-branch checkpoint.
  Older checkpoints without embedded config can infer the minimal legacy branch
  layout from the final U-Net layer shape.
- Keeps each model option as a coherent raw seven-channel accumulator product:
  `dir0_z`, `dir1_z`, `dir0_y`, `dir1_y`, `dir0_x`, `dir1_x`, and `presence`.
  Those raw channels are internal only.
- Finalizes each raw option slab into persisted Lasagna-style
  `presence`, `nx`, and `ny` OME-Zarr channels. The six direction channels are
  decoded through the package-safe `lasagna.normal_encoding` helpers before
  compact `nx/ny` encoding.
- Legacy grouped outputs become one option product per branch. Conditioned
  recurrent inference can emit one option product per recurrent step. Resume
  completeness for an option requires the persisted `presence/nx/ny` sibling
  chunks to exist.

`fiber_trace_3d/prediction.py`

- Decodes raw fiber model samples shared by tiled inference and native
  Trace2CP: either six direction-only Lasagna 3x2 channels or grouped
  seven-channel options (`dir0_z`, `dir1_z`, `dir0_y`, `dir1_y`, `dir0_x`,
  `dir1_x`, `presence`). It returns ZYX directions, presence, and validity
  masks while reusing the analytic Lasagna 3x2 decoder.

`fiber_trace_3d/infer.py`

- Provides tiled OME-Zarr inference for trained 3D fiber models:

  ```bash
  PYTHONPATH=lasagna:vesuvius/src:. python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_3d.infer <config.json> --input <volume.zarr/level> --output <fiber_out.lasagna.json> --checkpoint <snapshot.pt>
  ```

- Reuses the shared predict3d mechanics for crop handling, canonical tile and
  output-chunk lattices, automatic S3 download from `_download` metadata,
  fixed-depth circular product accumulation, output-chunk-only resume, temp cleanup, and
  atomic chunk writes.
- Common tiled arguments are `--input`, `--output`, `--checkpoint`,
  `--tile-size`, `--overlap`, `--border`, `--inference-scaledown-power`, `--crop`,
  `--device`, `--devices`, `--download-workers`, `--no-download`, `--levels`, `--ome-chunk`, and
  `--pyramid-workers`.
- Use all visible GPUs with `--devices all`, or select a subset such as
  `--devices cuda:0,cuda:2`. `--device` retains the single-device/CPU path and
  cannot be combined with `--devices`.
- `--download-workers` controls parallel automatic S3 chunk transfers and
  defaults to 64. It is separate from CPU tile `--prefetch-workers`, GPU
  `--slots-per-gpu`, and output `--pyramid-workers`.
- Fiber defaults to `--inference-scaledown-power 2`: filtered factor-4 output,
  or 0.25x per axis relative to the selected input. Power 0 keeps full input
  resolution. This is independent of the tracer/model config's `scaledown`.
  The emitted `.lasagna.json` uses the existing Lasagna manifest schema only:
  top-level `source_to_base` plus each prediction group's `scaledown` records
  the persisted prediction scale relative to base. The manifest does not
  serialize the selected tracing/input scale separately.
- Model/interpolation tensor sizing remains floor-divided. OME-Zarr storage
  shapes and crop-region exclusive endpoints instead use ceil division, matching
  the pyramid creator and ensuring odd edge planes are included in chunk
  scheduling and writes.

### Shared 3D tiled runner

Both entry points terminate in `lasagna.tiled_predict3d.run_tiled_inference_3d`:

```text
Lasagna CLI -> LasagnaCosPredict3DAdapter --+
                                               +-> run_tiled_inference_3d
Fiber CLI   -> FiberTrace3DPredictAdapter ---+       |
                                                       +-> per-scale circular mmap rings
                                                       +-> chunk atomic output writes
```

The runner traverses the globally anchored model-tile lattice once. Model
adapters provide preprocessing, model execution, raw product splitting, and
raw-to-persisted conversion; they do not own traversal, accumulation, resume,
or flushing. `OutputProductSpec.inference_scaledown` describes a product's
scale relative to the selected input array for runner geometry only; it is not
serialized into `.lasagna.json`. `scaledown` remains the persisted
base-relative manifest scale.

For multi-GPU execution, the runner lazily advances the same nested Z/Y/X
lattice and never creates its Cartesian job list. By default one shared
TensorStore Zarr driver asynchronously reads bounding boxes into an independent
bounded prefetch window. A ready tile is copied into reusable shared memory only
when an input slot, result slot, and GPU queue are available. One persistent
spawned process per GPU performs normalization, model inference, weighting, and
filtered scaledown. Weighted results use separate fixed shared-memory slots;
process queues carry descriptors only. Results may complete out of order, but the
coordinator commits them in canonical order and flushes a Z row only after all
of that row's inference and skip events commit. Consequently the coordinator
remains the sole owner of the circular rings, resume checks, progress, and Zarr
write scheduling. `--slots-per-gpu` controls GPU shared-memory depth;
`--prefetch-tiles-per-gpu` independently controls outstanding/ready reads.
TensorStore cache/file-I/O/copy concurrency are explicit. The `python-zarr`
fallback uses `--prefetch-workers`. Single-device inference submits the same
bounded canonical TensorStore future window before synchronous model forwards.

For volumes too large to retain locally, both entry points can pass
`--live-fetch`. `lasagna.live_omezarr_cache` validates the selected local
numeric level against its S3 source, lazily materializes at most 10,000 cheap
canonical tile descriptors ahead, and admits only completed materializations
to the independently bounded TensorStore tile-array window. It inventories and
accounts only the selected scale. After a complete canonical Z row commits,
the runner may delete whole cached Z-chunk planes strictly behind the safe
input frontier until actual resident bytes fall below the default 10 TiB
target. Protected/current/future planes are never deleted, and lack of a safe
plane produces a conservative temporary overshoot rather than a stall.
Selected-level advisory locks prevent cooperating bulk download, live mutation,
and ordinary inference readers from colliding. Remote listings are authoritative;
`.noremote` remains advisory and eviction never records remote absence.

The shared multi-device runner's opt-in `--profile-pipeline` diagnostics use
streaming aggregates and callbacks bounded by that prefetch window. They report
read service/active span/throughput/effective outstanding-request concurrency,
completion and ready delays,
shared-memory copy, worker CPU conversion, H2D, mixed adapter preprocessing,
model inference, output/D2H, result receipt, and commit. CUDA events are
recorded on the inference stream and read after the existing terminal sync.
With profiling disabled, no callbacks or CUDA events are created and workers
retain the legacy result message.

CUDA workers copy the source uint8/uint16 tile before expanding it. UInt16 uses
the historical floor division by 257, then normalization is performed in CUDA
FP32 before adapter preprocessing. Fiber model autocast remains scoped inside
`FiberTrace3DPredictAdapter.run_tile_inference`; its output is restored to FP32
before shared product transformation, weighting, scaledown, and D2H.

Fiber CLI `--inference-precision auto` reads the checkpoint's saved
`config.training.mixed_precision` policy. Literal `bf16`/`fp16` policies are
validated on every selected device; missing/off metadata uses FP32, while
invalid, unsupported, or historically ambiguous saved `auto` policy warns and
falls back to FP32. Explicit `fp32`, `bf16`, or `fp16` overrides take priority
and unsupported explicit modes fail. This metadata records training policy,
not the dtype of checkpoint parameter tensors.

Each distinct inference scale has separate raw-product float32 mmap rings by
default and one shared float32 geometric weight ring. Experimental
`--product-accumulator-dtype float16` halves product backing but measured much
slower with NumPy CPU accumulation on the target machine. Flush
workers widen each bounded chunk before normalization; FP16 reduces ring
backing/mmap traffic, not float32 chunk-temporary RAM. Unbounded custom products
should use float32. Fiber and Lasagna use the same repeated
separable `[1,4,6,4,1]/16` blur plus 2x decimation for both weighted
predictions and weights. Predictions are weighted before filtering and then
normalized by the filtered denominator, so power 2 is not stride-4 sampling.
The tile `border` is zeroed before filtering; filtering may extend positive
denominator support from retained core voxels into that border, but discarded
border predictions never contribute.

A logical Z plane maps to
`physical_z = logical_z % ring_depth`; generation checks prevent an unflushed
plane from being overwritten. Ring depth is planned from actual canonical tile
positions and chunk-aligned flush frontiers. Planning mirrors runtime order:
each Z row writes before its post-row flush. One runner-wide flush batch handled
by persistent spawn-process workers may retain the preceding finalized
interval while the next row accumulates.
The planner simulates that exact write, join/release, submit, next-write order,
so the enlarged ring has disjoint physical slots without copying live overlap
or finalized bands. At the following advancing frontier the coordinator waits
if necessary, then clears/releases the completed interval before submitting
another; storage slowdown creates bounded backpressure rather than additional
queued bands. Workers receive only mmap-path/chunk descriptors, reopen mappings
read-only, and allocate one chunk of temporary arrays each. The CLI default is
the available CPU count capped at 64 workers; zero is the synchronous
immediate-release baseline. Backing size is
`(raw_channels + 1) * ring_depth * working_y * working_x * 4` bytes and does
not depend on full volume depth. Candidate output chunks are lazily checked
against their direct local Zarr-v2 input footprint. Their global output bounds
are clipped against the full output volume before conversion to selected-input
coordinates; crop-local ring dimensions are not source-support bounds.
Unsupported chunks stay absent in output and scratch. Flushes visit only
contribution-dirty chunks,
normalize with chunk-sized denominator scratch, atomically write coherent
channel bundles, clear only dirty regions, and only then release their logical
Z generations. Progress reports dirty/written/unsupported/resumed chunks and
actual scratch bytes touched and cleared. `flush stats work=... wait=...`
separates total background work from coordinator backpressure. Submitted work
does not advance `final_z`; completion does. Jobs contain immutable chunk
descriptors rather than decoded arrays, and shutdown waits for an active mmap
reader before closing scratch files.

While a flush runs, output completeness checks can inspect future disjoint
chunks and model inference can overlap product finalization. The shipped
adapters keep these operations stateless or filesystem-disjoint; custom shared
runner adapters must provide the same concurrency safety.

Fiber and Lasagna OME-Zarr outputs default to 64x64x64 chunks;
`--ome-chunk` remains an override.

Pyramid levels use multiprocessing across output chunks. With the default
`--pyramid-workers 0`, the existing automatic CPU-count process selection is
retained. Each process is constrained to one BLAS/OpenMP thread, including
OpenBLAS, MKL, BLIS, Apple vecLib, and NumExpr runtimes, so native libraries do
not multiply the process count by another CPU-count-sized thread pool. Parent
environment and native thread limits are restored when a level finishes or a
worker fails. `--pyramid-workers` remains available to tune I/O and memory
bandwidth performance.

Lasagna's optional `pred_dt` is an external-source stage after neural
inference. It is independently resumable and never schedules model tiles.

Ownership changed as follows:

| Concern | Before | Current owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lasagna traversal/flush | `_infer_tiled_3d` plus `_on_z_complete` | `run_tiled_inference_3d` |
| Fiber traversal/flush | `_infer_tiled_products_3d` | `run_tiled_inference_3d` |
| Model preprocessing/autocast/output split | partly embedded in each loop | model adapter |
| Tile lattice, resume, blend, rings, progress | duplicated/divergent | shared runner |
| Coherent atomic channel writes | output adapter | output adapter |
| Lasagna prediction EDT | Lasagna flush callback | independent Lasagna post-stage |
  Fiber-specific arguments are the positional config, `--recurrent-steps`,
  `--base-ref`, and `--base-scale`.
- Writes a Lasagna-style `.lasagna.json` manifest plus OME-Zarr groups derived
  from the manifest stem. A single-option run writes
  `<stem>_presence.ome.zarr`, `<stem>_nx.ome.zarr`, and
  `<stem>_ny.ome.zarr`; multi-option runs prefix channel names with
  `option_000_`, `option_001_`, etc.
- The fiber model's raw seven-channel option output is internal only. The
  shared circular accumulator stores raw `dir0_z/dir1_z/dir0_y/dir1_y/dir0_x/
  dir1_x/presence`, and the fiber adapter finalizes those raw slabs to
  persisted `presence/nx/ny` chunks using Lasagna's compact hemisphere
  encoding. Coarser presence and normal pyramids are built with the existing
  Lasagna pyramid helpers.

`fiber_trace_3d/loader.py`

- Parses Vesuvius-style JSON configs into `FiberTrace3DConfig`.
- Uses `fiber_trace_2d.fiber_json.load_fiber_file`, so VC3D JSON, NML, and
  dataset-level XYZ affine transforms follow the same rules as the 2D loader.
- Accepts optional Lasagna manifests for shape cross-checking. When a 3D
  training dataset omits `lasagna_manifest_path`, the loader derives
  `base_shape_zyx` from the raw OME-Zarr volume and validates the selected
  Zarr level against `base_volume_scale`.
- Samples ordinary CP-centered 3D ZYX patches from the selected Zarr level
  through explicit coordinates and the VC3D blocking coordinate sampler. It
  does not create fiber-aligned strips or slices for 3D input, and normal
  training no longer loads an oversized zarr block for torch `grid_sample`.
- Builds the final regular 3D patch with explicit coordinate maps.
  `backward_source_zyx` maps output voxels to source-volume coordinates for
  image sampling, while source fiber points are mapped into output patch
  coordinates by the matching analytic forward transform from the same
  augmentation parameters.
- Coordinate-space geometric augmentation supports CP-local shift, isotropic
  scale, arbitrary 3D rotation, independent axis flips, and opt-in smooth
  displacement. Smooth displacement modes (`1d`, `2d`, `3d`) are built as
  explicit paired maps; runtime paths do not invert one map direction by search
  or solve.
- Value augmentation includes normalization, brightness, contrast, gamma, noise,
  separable isotropic Gaussian blur, and opt-in anisotropic blur. Anisotropic
  blur is a torch value operation after volume sampling, not a geometric
  transform.
- Builds direction and presence targets in source-format-specific form.
  NML records supervise along the transformed fiber centerline by drawing
  rounded output-space line voxels; JSON/array records supervise only the
  sampled CP neighborhood. NML line targets are not radius-expanded tubes.
  Direction labels use the six Lasagna 3x2 channels, and presence negatives
  are balanced against routed positives. CP-only samples keep the
  shift-derived presence edge exclusion; NML dense-line samples supervise
  presence across the full valid patch.
- Prefetch uses the same explicit coordinate path as training and collects
  VC3D chunk dependencies instead of conservative zarr crop bboxes.

`fiber_trace_3d/projection.py`

- Projects analytically decoded six-channel Lasagna predictions into
  caller-provided 2D strip-frame axes. The frame axes may be constant or
  per-pixel arrays from a Trace2CP segment source.

`fiber_trace_3d/trace2cp_bridge.py`

- Samples dense 3D checkpoint outputs at explicit 2D Trace2CP strip
  coordinates, projects the six Lasagna direction channels into the local strip
  frame, carries presence values through, and calls the existing 2D Trace2CP
  scorer.
- This is for test/metric integration with the existing 2D tracer; 3D training
  and loading remain CP-centered block loading.

`fiber_trace_3d/trace2cp_tool.py`

- Provides a separate native 3D Trace2CP inspection CLI:

  ```bash
  python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_3d.trace2cp_tool <config.json> --checkpoint <snapshot.pt> --sample-index 13 --export-dir <dir>
  ```

- The native 3D CLI is metric-only by default: it traces, prints
  `native_trace2cp_plane_error` / `native_trace2cp_closest_target_error`
  or `native_trace2cp_fiber_restarts_per_kvx`, and writes
  `trace2cp_native_3d_summary.json`. Add `--vis` to render
  `trace2cp_native_3d_vis.jpg` and enable partial image updates during long
  renders.
- `--fiber-json <path>` without sample or CP selectors runs native whole-fiber
  tracing over all consecutive CP pairs from that fiber. Supplying
  `--fiber-json <path> --sample-index N` keeps deterministic flat
  single-segment inspection, and
  `--fiber-json <path> --start-cp-index A --target-cp-index B` keeps explicit
  single-segment debug mode. Existing `--sample-index` plus `--target-offset`
  selection remains available when no fiber JSON is supplied.
- `--whole-fiber-start-cp-index N` is valid in whole-fiber mode and traces CP
  `N` through the final CP. The reported restart-rate denominator is the
  original reference line length from CP `N` to the final CP.
- `--fiber-json <path> <path> ...` runs those fibers sequentially in
  whole-fiber mode using one shared loaded model. It writes indexed per-fiber
  outputs such as `trace2cp_native_3d_000_summary.json` and, with `--vis`,
  `trace2cp_native_3d_000_vis.jpg`, plus an accumulated
  `trace2cp_native_3d_summary_all.json` score over summed restarts and summed
  original-line reference length.
- Whole-fiber `--vis` output is page-split before JPEG's dimension limit:
  completed restart spans are packed into pages around a 32000-pixel target
  width, and a single very long no-restart span is split before the JPEG hard
  limit. Page zero uses the normal `_vis.jpg` path; later pages use numbered
  suffixes such as `_vis_001.jpg`.
- Whole-fiber CP markers keep the point visible. Distance labels are drawn at
  the bottom of each strip and include the CP index, for example
  `cp=17 d=3.2` or `cp=17 miss`, so the same index can be passed to
  `--start-cp-index` / `--target-cp-index`.
- Traces directly in selected-level ZYX voxel coordinates, not in a projected
  2D strip. It lazily runs dense 3D inference blocks around queried points,
  crops each block to a trusted core, and routes every candidate lookup to the
  block whose trusted core contains that point.
- Inference block inputs use the same sampler-backed loading convention as 3D
  training: regular selected-level block grids are multiplied by the dataset
  `volume_spacing_base`, validated against the base-volume shape, and sampled
  with the configured blocking `CoordinateSampler`. The native tool does not
  directly slice zarr/raw blocks for real configured volumes.
- Model input normalization is the configured 3D `image_normalization` value.
  With the current fast 3D config this is `zscore`: mean/std over valid voxels
  before model inference. Exported native Trace2CP volume panels show that same
  normalized input view: `zscore` uses a fixed `[-3, 3]` display window,
  `minmax` uses `0..1`, and raw/none modes clip raw `0..255`.
- The side/top strip render calls go through the 2D Trace2CP coordinate
  sampler path. Those render calls require a blocking sampler. In VC3D,
  `Volume.sample_coords(..., blocking=True)` now uses strict requested-level
  sampling: all required chunks are fetched/decoded and pinned before sampling,
  scale fallback is disabled, and the returned stats must report
  `requested_level_only=true` plus `fallback_levels=0`.
- Decodes Lasagna 3x2 direction channels analytically with the shared 3D
  direction decoder, aligns sign-ambiguous axes to the current trace direction,
  samples deterministic tangent-plane cone candidates at
  `--cone-angle-step-degrees` increments, and chooses candidates by minimizing
  `1 - dot(current_dir, step_dir) * dot(candidate_dir, step_dir) * candidate_presence`.
  The native default is a `25` degree cone with `5` degree candidate steps,
  giving 81 candidate directions including the center direction. The legacy
  `--cone-grid-size` square-grid path is only used when
  `--cone-angle-step-degrees <= 0`.
  `--candidate-substeps` defaults to `1`, which keeps that endpoint-only score.
  Higher values score each candidate segment at evenly spaced substeps, reduce
  branches independently at every substep, require all substeps valid, and
  average the selected substep scores before applying the current-direction
  gate. Beam mode batches this as `[frontier, candidate, substep, branch]`
  around the existing inferred-block cache.
  The sampled axes are sign-aligned before dot products are evaluated.
  For `7*K` grouped outputs, `NativeTraceFieldCache` decodes all `K`
  direction/presence branches. The current-point branch is selected by
  `dot(branch_dir, previous_step_dir) * branch_presence`, and each candidate
  point evaluates all branches before reducing to the best branch score. Native
  3D Trace2CP defaults to all-pairs direction product scoring: it compares the
  previous step direction, current-point sampled direction, candidate step
  direction, and candidate-point sampled direction with six clamped pairwise
  dot products, then multiplies that direction product by candidate presence.
  `--no-all-pairs-direction-product` restores the older
  `dot(current_dir, step_dir) * dot(candidate_dir, step_dir) * presence` score.
  Smoothness uses Lasagna normals sampled directly at candidate trace points
  through the established `fiber_trace_2d` geometry-loader sampler. That path
  remains the production behavior source of truth. The debug-only
  `--debug-compare-normal-sampler` option can run sparse Lasagna sampling in
  parallel and fail fast on valid-mask or angular differences, while the tracer
  still scores with the baseline geometry-loader normals.
  With a valid candidate normal, `--smoothness-tangent-weight` penalizes turns
  within the tangent plane perpendicular to the normal and
  `--smoothness-normal-weight` penalizes elevation change into/out of the
  normal direction. The native CLI defaults to
  `--smoothness-tangent-weight 10.0` and
  `--smoothness-normal-weight 0.1`. Native Trace2CP fails before tracing if
  those normal-aware terms, or cumulative tangent smoothness, are active and no
  Lasagna normal sampler is available. If a sampler exists but a candidate
  normal sample is invalid, that candidate falls back to the older isotropic
  previous-step smoothness. In
  addition, each greedy/beam state carries a running history heading. The
  optional cumulative smoothness term compares candidates against that heading
  only after projecting both into the candidate Lasagna-normal tangent plane.
  This uses `--cumulative-smoothness-steps` and
  `--cumulative-smoothness-tangent-weight`, is added to `smoothness_loss`, and
  does not affect normal/elevation or direction/presence gates. Native 3D
  Trace2CP does not expose additive direction/presence candidate-selection
  weights.
- The first search step samples the model direction at the start CP. The
  adjacent CP-local fiber-line tangent toward the target CP's line index is
  only the reference used to choose and sign-align that sampled start branch;
  it does not become the trace direction itself and the straight CP-to-CP chord
  is not used. For grouped multi-direction outputs, this start selection uses
  pure angular agreement to the CP-local tangent and ignores branch presence.
  The selected sampled start direction is then treated as the current,
  previous, and history direction for the first candidate step, so regular
  direction scoring and normal-aware/cumulative smoothness apply immediately.
  Later steps use the sampled model direction at the current point, aligned to
  the previous accepted trace step, with the normal-aware smoothness described
  above.
  Native Trace2CP now uses beam search by default (`--beam-width 8`) instead of
  committing greedily at every step. Each beam expands the same branch-aware
  candidate score for `--beam-lookahead-steps` future steps before pruning
  (default `2`), cumulative loss selects the best target-plane-reaching state,
  and `--beam-prune-distance-voxels` merges near-duplicate live states after
  the lookahead expansion. `--beam-width 1` preserves the previous greedy
  control flow and does not use lookahead. Beam candidate selection is batched
  across the active frontier states for each lookahead depth: cone candidates
  are generated in torch, current-point branch selection and candidate scoring
  run as tensor operations, target-plane crossing is evaluated in batch, and
  tensor pruning keeps the next live frontier before only the selected path is
  reconstructed as Python trace steps. Candidate point sampling uses the
  bounded GPU-resident inferred-block cache; cache misses still read VC3D
  source blocks before forwarding new inference blocks, and the current lookup
  still groups points by trusted inference block before sampling tensors on
  `cache.device`.
- Uses a distance-derived step guard by default:
  `ceil(max_step_factor * cp_distance_voxels / step_voxels)`, with
  `--max-step-factor 3.0`. `--max-steps` is an optional extra cap, and
  `--trace-step-limit` intentionally produces partial traces for debugging.
  Forward/backward progress bars report distance-derived target progress, ETA,
  step count, and inferred-block count; progress does not use a CP chord
  target-plane normal.
- Target-plane termination uses target-local planes only. For each one-way
  trace, the target CP contributes up to two line-neighbor planes
  (`target CP -> next line point`, `target CP -> previous line point`) plus one
  inferred-direction plane sampled from the model at the target CP and
  sign-aligned to the local target tangent. The trace keeps stepping until all
  configured planes have been crossed, then selects the crossing with the
  lowest in-plane CP error. Python and C++ whole-fiber tracing also require that
  best crossing error to be within the configured restart threshold before
  accepting the segment; until then it keeps tracing within the remaining
  budget and replaces stored crossings when a later crossing of the same target
  plane is closer to the CP. The straight CP-to-CP chord is not a termination
  plane.
  The shared C++ tracer used by VC3D and `vc_fiber_trace_metric` implements the
  same construction with fixed-capacity state for these three derived planes.
  Each beam and compact lazy-lookahead frontier carries its own crossed mask
  and best interpolated crossing per plane. Shared C++ CP-pair traces receive
  the endpoint error threshold, continue after out-of-threshold crossings, and
  retain the complete unsnapped path for post-trace meeting search. Whole-fiber
  traces use the selected crossing for the error metric but retain the actual
  stepped endpoint for continuation.
- When `--vis` is enabled, native strip rendering prints coarse stage progress
  for side/top volume rendering, coordinate extraction, side/top presence
  sampling, trace overlay projection, and image composition. Presence sampling
  also prints block-level progress with sampled points, valid outputs, newly
  inferred blocks, cached blocks, and total cache blocks.
- Inferred block outputs are cached on the tracing device under the
  `--max-cached-inference-gib` LRU budget. Point lookup samples resident
  output tensors on `cache.device`; long traces and presence-strip renders are
  still bounded by eviction rather than retaining all historical blocks.
- With `--vis`, the regular `trace2cp_native_3d_vis.jpg` path is overwritten at
  render start, each stage start/end, and after each panel is added to the
  sheet. Before the first panel exists, the file contains a small status
  canvas, so there is always one current status/partial/final image to inspect
  during long renders.
- In whole-fiber `--vis` mode, `trace2cp_native_3d_vis.jpg` is also overwritten
  after every completed CP segment. The whole-fiber sheet has eight stitched rows:
  initial side volume, initial side 3D presence, initial top volume, initial top
  3D presence, regenerated side volume, regenerated side 3D presence,
  regenerated top volume, and regenerated top 3D presence. Those rows are
  rendered as restart-delimited continuous long strips rather than one visual
  column per CP segment. Failed segment overlays are cut before the next CP
  region and the displayed trace resumes from the restart CP in the next
  long-strip span. Whole-fiber visualization uses a fixed 64 px cross-strip
  width; paths leaving that strip are clipped visually only. The initial
  side/top presence rows show raw inferred presence. The regenerated/fused
  presence rows multiply presence by the ambiguous predicted direction's
  sign-invariant alignment to the displayed strip plane, computed from the
  strip coordinate grid.
- Single-pair stdout/summary metrics are `native_trace2cp_plane_error` and
  `native_trace2cp_closest_target_error`; these are tool-local diagnostics and
  do not replace the projected `test/trace2cp_error` metric used by training.
- Whole-fiber mode traces continuously from CP plane to CP plane. A segment
  succeeds when it reaches the next CP plane within the segment budget and its
  in-plane error to the target CP, converted from selected-volume voxels to
  base voxels with `volume_spacing_base`, is at most
  `--whole-fiber-error-threshold-base-voxels` (default `20`). Success only advances
  target-CP bookkeeping: it keeps the actual live trace point, previous step
  direction, sampled-current direction when cached, and smoothing-history
  direction. The selected plane crossing is used for metric/error reporting,
  not as a new trace start. Failures count one restart and resume from the
  failed target CP. Human stdout/progress prints compact error rates as
  `err/kvx=...` and, when physical units are available, `err/m=...`, rounded to
  one decimal. Reference lengths and `physical_unit=m` are omitted from human
  progress output. Live progress uses carriage-return updates on one terminal
  line and prints a newline only at completion. Physical per-meter output is
  optional and comes only from the VC3D sampler's
  `record.sampler.volume.metadata["voxelsize"]` value, interpreted as
  micrometers and converted to meters. If VC3D does not expose a finite
  positive `voxelsize`, stdout/progress omit physical units and JSON stores
  null for the per-meter fields. The fiber code does not parse Zarr/OME JSON,
  dataset config, record metadata, alternate keys, or filenames for physical
  units. The JSON summary includes per-segment status, errors, step counts,
  restart points, the last successful reference arc distance, reference
  lengths, full-precision `native_trace2cp_fiber_restarts_per_kvx`, optional
  full-precision `native_trace2cp_fiber_restarts_per_meter`, and the old
  segment fraction only as `restart_fraction_per_segment`.
- The shared C++ CP-pair tracer fuses forward and reverse traces in trace-grid
  3D ZYX coordinates without sorting by straight-axis progress. It repeatedly
  moves a local tangent plane along each resampled path and intersects the
  other path, adds endpoint-plane candidates, and selects the smallest raw
  meeting error with deterministic progress/index tie breaking. The pair is
  accepted when its base-voxel error is at most
  `max(10, meetingAcceptMaxErrorRatio * combined partial traced arc)`, including
  when neither one-way trace reached its endpoint planes. Both
  partial traces are cut at their interpolated meeting positions, warped to
  their midpoint by cumulative arc-length fraction, concatenated, and
  arc-length-resampled. Result diagnostics expose meeting error in trace and
  base voxels, ratio, traced length, source, and a stable failure code.
- For single-pair visualization, first builds a maximum-height initial side/top
  Trace2CP source to project the native forward, backward, and fused traces.
  The rendered cross-strip height is then reduced to the odd centered size that
  covers those projected traces with 50% extra margin, capped by the configured
  maximum. The JPG includes initial side/top volume and 3D-presence panels with
  projected forward/reverse/fused traces, plus fused-line-resampled side/top
  volume and presence panels with only the fused line drawn thinly. Whole-fiber
  mode does not use this adaptive height path.
- Trace2CP segment-source construction trims extra margin points to the valid
  compact-geometry interval containing both CPs. Compact-geometry preload covers
  consecutive CP-to-CP spans as well as CP source windows, so an interior
  Trace2CP span point should not be invalid merely because it was never sampled.
  It still fails if the actual CP-to-CP line range crosses sampled invalid
  Lasagna normal data; no missing normal fill-in is performed.
- Forward, reverse, and fused native 3D traces are converted back to base XYZ
  and projected onto the initial side/top strip coordinate systems for overlay
  only. Presence sampling is batched per strip through the native 3D inference
  cache rather than running per-pixel model calls.

`fiber_trace_3d/train.py`

- Command-line entry point:

  ```bash
  python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_3d.train <config.json>
  ```

- Supports `--prefetch`, `--prefetch-steps`, `--benchmark`, `--load-only`,
  `--resume`, `--trace2cp-vis`, and the normal-training-only
  `--test-hang-diagnostics` flag.
- Multi-GPU training uses the standard `torchrun` launch environment and does
  not require config changes:

  ```bash
  torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=2 -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_3d.train <config.json>
  ```

  The configured `batch_size` is local to each rank, so the effective
  optimizer-step batch is `batch_size * WORLD_SIZE`. Each rank receives a
  disjoint deterministic training-stream slice, and `training.loader_workers`
  is also per rank. CUDA DDP converts
  `BatchNorm3d` modules to `SyncBatchNorm` automatically; single-process
  training keeps regular `BatchNorm3d`. Dense test batches are partitioned
  deterministically across every rank by global batch ID. TensorBoard, stdout
  progress, checkpoints, Trace2CP metrics, and sample sheets remain rank-0-only,
  and snapshots are saved without DDP `module.` key prefixes.
  Each rank retains a second process-worker DataLoader for tests with the same
  worker/prefetch settings as training. Gathered per-batch metric rows are
  sorted back into global order on rank 0 before applying the historical
  unweighted batch mean. Rank 0 reuses evaluated global batch zero for the test
  sample sheet. Test completion prints `test_timing ... total_seconds=...` and
  logs `timing/test_total_seconds` to TensorBoard.
  Hang diagnostics are disabled by default. Enable them explicitly with the
  JSON boolean `training.test_hang_diagnostics_enabled: true` or the normal
  training flag `--test-hang-diagnostics`. When enabled, every rank writes an
  append-only `<run_dir>/hang_diagnostics_rank_<rank>.log`; rank 0 guards the
  complete configured-test routine with an automatic traceback dump after
  eight minutes (`training.test_watchdog_seconds`, default `480`, required to
  be below the 600-second process-group timeout). Dense-test batch loading,
  target creation, forward/CUDA synchronization, CPU loss conversion, test
  visualization, Trace2CP, and TensorBoard flush have flushed phase markers
  with process and CUDA-memory counters. Disabled mode creates no log, handler,
  timer, resource polling, or diagnostic CUDA synchronization.
  On platforms with `SIGUSR2`, `kill -USR2 <pid>` appends an immediate
  all-thread Python traceback to that rank's file; find rank 0 with
  `ps -eo pid,cmd | grep 'fiber_trace_3d.train'`.
  `--prefetch`, `--benchmark`, and `--trace2cp-vis` remain single-process
  modes and reject `WORLD_SIZE > 1`; they also reject
  `--test-hang-diagnostics` because it is a normal-training option.
- Writes snapshots to `<run_path>/<run_name>_<datestr>/snapshots/current.pt`
  and `best.pt`. `training.kept_snapshot_interval` additionally keeps numbered
  snapshots as `snapshots/step_<iteration>.pt` and defaults to `10000`.
  Fiber3d snapshots are written only after dense test evaluation:
  `checkpoint_interval` must be a positive multiple of `test_interval`, and
  `kept_snapshot_interval` must be `0` or a multiple of `test_interval`.
  `best.pt` tracks the lowest dense `test/loss_total`; training and Trace2CP
  metrics cannot select it.
- `training.mixed_precision` accepts `off`, `bf16`, `fp16`, and `auto`.
  Autocast wraps training loss, dense test loss, benchmark forward loss,
  TensorBoard sample-sheet inference, and Trace2CP metric/visual inference.
  BF16 uses no scaler; FP16 uses `torch.amp.GradScaler`, whose state is saved
  in snapshots when enabled. This is not gradient accumulation: the configured
  `batch_size` remains the real `BatchNorm3d` batch.
- Logs scalar losses/timings and the full training config JSON to TensorBoard
  when `training.tensorboard_enabled` is true. Direction reporting includes
  `train/angle_mean_deg` and, when held-out `test_datasets` are configured,
  `test/angle_mean_deg`.
- In conditioned mode, positive sparse supervision decodes two query samples at
  every supervised point: the zero/unconditioned query and a deterministic
  query sampled from the plane perpendicular to the GT direction with
  `training.conditioned_perpendicular_jitter_degrees` jitter. Both queries
  supervise the same GT direction with weighted MSE on the six Lasagna 3x2
  channels and positive-presence BCE.
- Conditioned dense negative supervision decodes zero-query and deterministic
  random-query outputs over all `presence_mask` voxels, including positive
  pixels by design. Positive and negative query BCEs are normalized per
  `(patch, query)` group; the default component weights are both `1.0`, so the
  dense negative term is weak per voxel but has equal component weight overall.
- Legacy grouped-output configs still use selected-branch routing by
  `abs(dot(decoded_predicted_axis, target_axis)) * predicted_presence`, with
  the deterministic `2x2x2` anti-collapse repair during training and raw
  per-voxel routing during eval. The default 3D loss weights are
  `direction_weight: 10.0` and `presence_weight: 1.0`.
- Passing `--resume /path/to/current.pt` for normal training restores the
  model and optimizer state from that snapshot, continues from the stored step,
  and still creates a fresh timestamped run directory. The TensorBoard config
  text records the effective CLI resume path. After optimizer state restore,
  the current config's `training.learning_rate` and `training.weight_decay`
  are reapplied to every optimizer param group, so AdamW moments/step counters
  resume from the checkpoint while these supported hyperparameters can be
  changed in the config.
- `training.max_steps: 0` means the deterministic training stream repeats
  indefinitely until interrupted. Positive `max_steps` values remain absolute
  target steps, including when resuming.
- `stream_index` is the unbounded deterministic stream position. It drives all
  random sources: geometric/value augmentation, jitter/noise, and branch-choice
  grid offsets. `data_index` is the bounded dataset-selection position after
  `training.max_sample_index` / `sample_index_limit` wrapping and is only for
  data reads/CP selection and debug reporting.
- `training.max_sample_index` bounds CP/data sample selection to a deterministic
  `data_index` prefix. Augmentation parameters and all other random sources are
  still seeded by `stream_index`, so reused CP/data samples receive fresh
  deterministic transforms on later repeats.
- When `test_interval > 0`, configured test evaluation also runs once at step
  0 before the first optimizer step, so initial performance is visible.
- Logs `train_sample_3d/principal_slices` at `training.sample_vis_interval`.
  The sheet concatenates up to `training.sample_vis_count` batch samples side
  by side, defaulting to four. `training.test_sample_vis_count` controls the
  corresponding dense test sheet count. Each sample block uses five rows: the
  sampled CP's three principal planes, a longitudinal slice containing the GT
  CP tangent, and a perpendicular/cross slice whose plane normal is the GT CP
  tangent. Single-output rows have five columns: volume image with projected GT
  line and predicted CP direction overlay where applicable, target/context
  presence, raw predicted presence, predicted presence weighted by the cosine
  to the slice normal, and predicted presence weighted by the cosine to the GT
  tangent. Multi-output rows keep the branch summary columns: first prediction
  presence, second prediction presence, prediction presence closer to the slice
  normal, other prediction presence, max prediction presence, min prediction
  presence, and average prediction presence. In conditioned mode the first
  prediction is the zero-query output and the second is the recurrent output
  conditioned on the first decoded direction; in legacy multi-branch mode these
  columns are branch outputs. The
  GT line overlay draws target-line portions within 2 voxels of
  the displayed principal slice plane. The two
  oblique rows project/rasterize the carried transformed line segments into
  the oblique slice frame for both the image overlay and target/context panel.
  The target/context presence panel is max-pooled for visualization only;
  principal rows max-pool in 3D and oblique rows thicken the projected
  oblique-frame raster in 2D. The loss target is unchanged. The predicted CP
  direction is drawn as a thin
  anti-aliased line whose length is scaled by the in-slice projection
  magnitude, so directions pointing out of the slice appear shorter.
- Configured dense 3D tests write `test_sample_3d/principal_slices` using the
  same sheet layout when they run at step 0 and test intervals. Test scalars and
  images are flushed immediately after configured test logging.
- Dense 3D test loaders do not inherit training augmentations by default.
  Set `training.test_augment_enabled: true` only when intentionally evaluating
  augmented test samples. Dense tests default to every held-out CP once in the
  deterministic pseudo-random test stream from sample index zero;
  `training.test_control_points: 0` is the explicit full-test sentinel, and
  positive values cap tests to a deterministic random held-out range for
  debugging.
- `batch_size` is the actual CP-patch batch passed through the 3D U-Net. The
  trainer does not internally micro-batch.
- Normal training, distributed dense tests, and `--benchmark --load-only` use
  `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` process workers when
  `training.loader_workers > 0`. Each worker lazily constructs its own
  `FiberTrace3DLoader` and VC3D coordinate sampler, and each DataLoader item is
  a complete `FiberTrace3DBatch` keyed by deterministic batch index.
  Training and test DataLoaders retain separate persistent worker pools on each
  rank so test prefetch is reusable across step 0 and every test interval.
- Public 3D loader calls may still accept `sample_index` for compatibility, but
  its semantics are `stream_index`. `sample_index_limit` derives bounded
  `data_index` CP/data selection from that stream index; augmentation seeding
  and all random-source seeding remain keyed to `stream_index`, so
  bounded-prefix repeats do not replay identical transforms.
- For 3D loading, omitted or `null` `volume_cache_memory_mib` resolves in
  Python to a 512 MiB VC3D decoded/hot-cache cap per loader/worker. Explicit
  positive values override this default.
- Worker batches are returned on CPU. The main process transfers the complete
  batch to the configured training device before model execution. Console
  `load_ms` includes DataLoader wait plus this main-process transfer;
  `to_device_ms` reports the transfer portion separately.
- Worker batches do not include full dense supervision tensors. They carry
  compact target descriptors instead: CP-only samples store local CP/tangent
  metadata plus visualization-only transformed line segments, and NML dense-line
  samples store transformed output-space segment endpoints plus patch bboxes for
  supervision. The main process calls
  `fiber_trace_3d.targets.materialize_targets(...)` after transfer to create
  dense presence targets/masks on the training device. Direction supervision is
  sparse: the materializer builds `direction_indices_bzyx`,
  `direction_target_sparse`, and `direction_weight_sparse`, and the loss
  gathers the predicted six-channel direction output at those supervised
  centerline/CP voxels. The normal training path does not allocate a full
  dense `[B,6,Z,Y,X]` direction target.
- For JSON/non-NML fibers, line segments in `target_segment_*` are used by
  train/test visualization to draw the approximate fiber line through the patch.
  Target materialization filters segment metadata by target mode, so these
  CP-only visualization segments do not become dense presence or direction
  supervision. Their loss still uses the transformed local CP tangent over the
  CP neighborhood. The TensorBoard target/context presence column can still
  render those segments for inspection; that raster is display-only.
- In `--benchmark` mode, `cpu_ms` and `cpu_x` report sampled CPU time for the
  main process plus DataLoader worker processes during each benchmark row where
  `/proc/<pid>/stat` is available. `cpu_x=1.0` is roughly one fully occupied
  CPU core for that row.
- The 3D load-only benchmark also exposes worker-side stage timings when using
  DataLoader workers: `worker_ms`, `worker_cpu`, `cpu/w`, loader construction,
  descriptor lookup, augmentation parameter sampling, coordinate-map creation,
  coordinate conversion/valid-mask generation, VC3D volume sampling, tensor
  conversion, value augmentation, compact target-spec generation, and batch
  stacking. Main-process target materialization is reported separately with
  `target_ms` plus sparse/dense target columns such as `line_idx`, `cp_idx`,
  `scatter`, `dir_enc`, `gpu_mask`, `linePts`, `dirPts`, and `posK`. `wait_ms`
  is the main process blocking on the next DataLoader item; it is distinct from
  `to_device_ms`, the CPU-to-training-device transfer. With worker processes,
  the first `loader_workers` benchmark rows can include worker-local loader
  construction and should be excluded from steady-state throughput summaries.
- When `training.test_trace2cp_enabled` is true, test evaluation builds
  Trace2CP side-strip geometry with the 2D loader, runs tiled dense 3D inference
  blocks over the requested strip coordinates, projects direction/presence into
  the 2D frame, and logs `test/trace2cp_error` as a diagnostic. Dense
  `test/loss_total` remains the sole metric used for fiber3d snapshot selection.
- Native 3D Trace2CP uses a field-provider boundary. The current provider is
  `NativeTraceFieldCache`, a sparse live checkpoint-backed block cache. It
  samples regular requested-level volume blocks through
  `CoordinateSampler.sample_block_zyx(...)`, batches missing blocks for model
  forwarding where memory permits, calls `FiberTrace3DPredictAdapter` for
  per-tile normalization, recurrent/conditioned inference, mixed precision, and
  raw option splitting, stores decoded trusted-core model outputs on the
  tracing device under the configured LRU byte budget, then exposes
  branch-aware point sampling to the tracer. Precomputed fiber prediction
  outputs are not wired yet, but should use the same field-provider contract
  when added.
- VC3D contains an initial native C++ segment tracer under
  `volume-cartographer/core/include/vc/fiber_tracer/` and
  `volume-cartographer/core/src/fiber_tracer/`. The core target
  `vc_fiber_tracer` is Qt-free, reads persisted fiber inference
  `presence`/`nx`/`ny` channels from a Lasagna-style manifest, and uses the
  shared `vc_lasagna` compact-channel sampling helper instead of duplicating
  `LasagnaNormalSampler` internals. VC projects keep regular and fiber
  manifests in the canonical `lasagna_datasets` collection; the reserved
  `vc-lasagna-fiber` tag marks fiber inference data, while no tag means regular
  Lasagna data. The reader migrates the older separate
  `fiber_inference_datasets` project field into tagged entries. The VC3D File
  menu can attach local or remote manifests and automatically exposes all
  referenced channels as flat ordinary 3D project volumes. Each attached group
  names one channel and references one actual ZYX array. Older flat CZYX
  preprocessing/fit intermediates require conversion and are not projected by
  VC3D; generic volumes remain 3D-only. If that exact source is already attached
  as an independent primary volume, VC3D preserves its independent ownership
  only after validating shape, dtype, fill value, level/chunk layout, and
  manifest-authoritative voxel spacing. UUIDs may differ between the ordinary
  volume and Lasagna wrapper; incompatible metadata rejects the whole manifest
  attachment.

  The VC3D line annotation GUI resolves the selected tagged fiber entry and
  exposes a checked Ctrl-right-click `Interpolation goal` submenu for each
  CP-to-CP span. `Global`, `Cubic spline`, `Lasagna`, and `Fiber trace` all
  route through the grouped coordinator in
  `apps/VC3D/LineAnnotationFiberSegments.cpp`; the earlier one-span
  trace/revert worker is removed. The task uses the existing line-optimization
  busy state, so line edits are blocked while it runs. Fiber lines remain
  stored in base coordinates. For trace spans, the GUI derives the sd2 scale
  from the prediction manifest, divides the base line into trace coordinates,
  opens both prediction and regular-normal samplers at that trace scale, and
  runs the native tracer there. Accepted points are multiplied back to base
  coordinates, original endpoints are restored exactly, and the final line is
  rebuilt with the ordinary base-space normal sampler. The `20`-base-voxel
  endpoint threshold controls how long each one-way trace continues; at sd2 it
  is `5` trace voxels. Final CP-pair acceptance uses a base-voxel meeting-error
  limit of `max(10, 10% of the combined partial traced length)`. A finite
  positive base voxel size adds micrometer diagnostics, but is not required for
  tracing and does not affect acceptance.

  `vc3d_fiber` version 3 requires a general descriptor in each non-final CP's
  `segment_to_next`. `interp_goal` records `global`/`cspline`/`lasagna`/`trace`;
  `interp_mode` records the actual `cspline`/`lasagna`/`trace` producer.
  Mode-dependent `metric`, compact `msg`, trace diagnostics, and Lasagna
  fallback detail live in the same CP-owned object. Version-1 arrays load as
  global Lasagna spans; all new saves write version 3. The unpublished file
  version 2 and its pre-v3 descriptors are rejected. The C++ strict readers,
  Python loader, Lasagna probe, Atlas reader, and merge validator accept only
  file versions 1, 3 and 4 (version 4 is version 3 plus optional span tags) and strictly validate v3 enums and mode-specific
  fields. Version 3 also requires a valid top-level `optimization_mode`; no
  reader synthesizes either field or repairs malformed v3 input. Version 3's
  current `tracer_version: 2` remains part of that strict
  descriptor schema. `normal_manifest` records the Lasagna source identity
  and `fiber_manifest` the prediction source identity actually consulted by a
  span. Controller sessions keep these identities separate from runtime cache
  paths. `OpenDataLasagna` reconstructs the public root manifest URL from the
  catalogue artifact URL and cached manifest filename; the catalogue exposes
  no standalone artifact UUID.

  C++ format validation is centralized in
  `core/include/vc/fiber_tracer/FiberJson.hpp`; VC3D, the metric runner,
  Lasagna probe, Atlas source loader, constraint exporter, and inspector all
  validate there before applying consumer-specific geometry requirements.
  Python format validation lives in the dependency-light
  `vesuvius/src/vc3d_fiber_format` package. The NumPy `Vc3dFiber` wrapper, NML
  loader, Lasagna atlas, and Spiral use it; Lasagna and Spiral contain only thin
  monorepo path adapters so their legacy standalone launch commands do not
  import the training stack. Sync retains its non-throwing boundary validator
  because it must convert untrusted local/remote/base input into manual
  conflicts, but enforces the same complete v3 descriptor contract.

  `vc_lasagna_line_probe` validates input through the shared C++ reader. An
  optimizing output reconstructs every CP-owned descriptor as actual Lasagna,
  preserves goals, records manifest provenance and per-span normal-alignment
  metrics, clears trace diagnostics, validates the complete result, and then
  renames it atomically. A non-optimizing output remains a metadata-preserving
  copy.

  `volume-cartographer/scripts/vc_sync.py` detects divergent local/S3 files
  against its last-synced shadow base and delegates valid fiber JSON to
  `scripts/fiber_merge.py`. For version 3, that merger locates every CP on the
  ordered dense line, partitions geometry at CPs common to base/local/remote,
  and compares complete dense-span/descriptor chunks. One-sided or identical
  changes are copied atomically. Local-only and remote-only runs are combined
  only across a complete unchanged base span; adjacent, overlapping, or
  unalignable edits return a manual conflict. `vc_sync` then preserves local,
  remote, and base copies and asks the user to keep local, keep remote, or
  skip. The v1 CP-polyline reoptimization fallback is not used for v3.
  Fiber-wide `optimization_mode` is merged separately with base-aware scalar
  rules rather than generation precedence. Existing tag, link-reciprocity,
  and manual-HV-tag merge rules remain unchanged.

  Goal resolution retries from policy each time: trace falls through to
  Lasagna and then cubic spline; Lasagna falls through to cubic spline. Global
  spans shorter than 100 base voxels choose cubic spline directly, while
  explicit goals bypass the shortcut. Trace is attempted independently per
  span. The coordinator invokes the existing shared Lasagna full
  reinitializer; its per-span failure index demotes only that span, then the
  coordinator retries with the new spline run protected. The final Ceres pass
  protects actual trace/cubic geometry and untouched manual spans.

  `core/include/vc/lasagna/LineSpline.hpp` and
  `core/src/lasagna/LineSpline.cpp` provide the shared normal-independent cubic
  interpolator. A maximal cubic run is solved together using exact CPs, shared
  internal tangents, optional hard boundary directions from neighboring dense
  geometry, bounded handles, deterministic forward/deviation checks, and base
  spacing resampling. CP movement/insertion/deletion marks adjacent spans dirty;
  cubic dirty regions expand through their connected run. Global-mode changes
  initially select only global goals, preserving explicit spans as boundaries.

  The toolbar still exposes fiber-global `Lasagna`/`Fiber model` mode and an
  explicit base-voxel extrapolation distance. `optimization_mode` selects tail
  behavior and resolves only `global` span goals. Switching it reoptimizes
  global spans and rebuilds both tails, including one-seed fibers; explicit
  segments remain fixed unless a changed boundary makes them part of the dirty
  dependency region. Changing distance immediately rebuilds tails when
  Auto-reoptimize is active. Before Lasagna reinitialization,
  `LineAnnotationFiberSegments.cpp` derives
  each successful native span's two endpoint tangents from the CP and the first
  distinct dense point inward. Every Lasagna span or retained tail on the
  opposite side receives the negated tangent as a hard outgoing direction.
  `LineOptimizer` creates one adjacent proxy sample on that direction and fixes
  it alongside the CP in the ordinary per-span and final stitched Ceres solves.
  The existing spacing and tangent/normal smoothness residuals optimize the
  remaining points. One constrained endpoint produces exactly one rollout
  candidate from that endpoint; two constrained endpoints produce one from
  each. Full reinitialization does not solve or score the previous Lasagna span
  or its endpoint directions. Directions propagated from solved neighboring
  spans likewise replace generic same-span CP/chord candidates. Normal-plane
  transport resolves a degenerate projection with a deterministic perpendicular
  tangent rather than retaining a normal-parallel input. Ordinary edits reuse
  unaffected spans and reoptimize only invalidated adjacency.

  Generated span labels come from the persisted descriptor. `T` shows meeting
  error in base voxels, `L` shows maximum normal-alignment error in degrees,
  and `C` has no metric; all modes may show `msg`. The dialog projects both
  endpoints, keeps partially visible spans labeled, clamps labels into the
  viewport, and deterministically packs them into one or two rows.

  Both open tails are first available from Lasagna reinitialization. Fiber mode
  then calls `traceFiberExtrapolation` over the shared one-way beam tracer in
  trace coordinates. Extrapolation passes no target planes: its requested
  distance produces `ceil(distance / nominal step)` generations, independent
  of `max_step_factor`, and the final generation uses the nominal remainder.
  Exhausting that generation count is successful without measuring accumulated
  arc length. Successful completion replaces that tail. If all next-step
  prediction directions are invalid, the
  shared tracer returns its last valid partial path with
  `no_valid_candidates`; VC3D uses it as a native tail ending at the data edge.
  A failure before producing an outward step retains the Lasagna tail, whose
  first point is hard-constrained by adjoining native geometry when the outer
  CP owns a successful native span. At each actual fallback site, the shared helper calls
  a typed diagnostic callback with the side, full trace/exception reason,
  returned point count, and source. `LineAnnotationController` supplies the
  callback and emits the VC3D command-line warning; completed length traces and
  accepted data-edge truncations never call it. CP-to-CP tracing continues to
  use target-local planes and its distance-scaled `max_step_factor` guard. The controller
  applies the combined line, CP metadata, and mode atomically and uses the same
  path for save-time finalization after no-reoptimization edits.

  `LineAnnotationDialog` owns a non-rendered full-width schematic overview in
  addition to the four rendered panes. The rendered pane topology is the
  current cut, side cut, interactive `lineSurface` strip, and interactive
  `lineSideSlice` strip. Both strip viewers share the same mouse-follow,
  control-point interaction, camera persistence, current-position overlay, and
  viewport-packed span-label behavior. In-place surface replacement snapshots
  the old generated-view data and tracks frame adoption independently for each
  rendered pane. Each strip continues drawing from the held data until its own
  displayed surface-geometry epoch reaches the new epoch; one strip completing
  cannot expose new labels over the other strip's stale image. Viewer and
  pending-state references are cleared before generated containers are deleted
  so synchronous teardown events cannot dereference partially destroyed panes.
- `volume-cartographer/apps/src/vc_fiber_trace_metric.cpp` is the native
  no-visualization metric runner for precomputed 3D fiber inference products.
  It opens a fiber inference `.lasagna.json`, loads one `vc3d_fiber` JSON,
  runs one-way CP-to-CP tracing continuously over the full fiber, restarts from
  a CP after failed target-plane hits, and prints `err/kvx` plus optional
  `err/m` when an explicit `--voxel-size-um` is provided. Its tracer working
  scale is derived by combining the persisted prediction scale from manifest
  fields with `--inference-scaledown-power`, which defaults to `2`. Persisted
  prediction channel scale is validated as `source_to_base * 2**scaledown` for
  every `presence`/`nx`/`ny` channel set; native tracing then uses
  `trace_to_base = prediction_to_base / 2**inference_scaledown_power` and
  `prediction_spacing_in_trace_voxels = 2**inference_scaledown_power`. The
  input fiber JSON is assumed to already be in the manifest base coordinate
  system. Segment acceptance uses
  `--error-threshold-base-voxels`, defaulting to `20`; the shared tracer
  converts each trace-grid error to base voxels before comparison. The default
  trace parameters are
  `step=4.0`, `cone_angle=25.0`, `cone_angle_step=5.0`,
  `cone_grid_size=25`, `beam_width=8`, `beam_prune_distance=1.0`,
  `beam_lookahead_steps=2`, `lookahead_parent_cap=32`, `smoothness_weight=2.0`,
  `smoothness_free_angle=0.0`, `smoothness_normal_weight=0.1`,
  `smoothness_tangent_weight=10.0`, `cumulative_smoothness_steps=4`, and
  `cumulative_smoothness_tangent_weight=2.0`, matching the Python Trace2CP
  default trace controls. It requires an explicit
  `--normal-manifest` Lasagna manifest and does not try to read normals from
  the fiber prediction manifest. The CLI is a thin wrapper around
  `vc_fiber_tracer`; it does not run PyTorch, create strips, or implement
  separate channel/remote-cache loading.
- The precomputed native tracer evaluates the final lookahead by ordering
  intermediate parents by cumulative-loss lower bound and original index. The
  default `--lookahead-parent-cap 32` intentionally limits second-step work;
  `--lookahead-parent-cap 0` uses exact lazy stopping, and
  `--exhaustive-lookahead` evaluates the full frontier. Persisted prediction
  and Lasagna-normal channels share one requested-level VC3D corner visitor:
  chunks are prefetched and pinned once per candidate batch, then each point's
  ordered corners are decoded and scored directly without candidate-sized
  per-volume corner arrays. Generic sampler sources retain the materialized
  fallback. The corner visitor interns points by integer voxel cube, gathers
  each physical volume's eight corners once per cube, and fans that record out
  to the original point indices with their individual fractions. Worker ranges
  are queued as one indexed `ThreadPool` batch with one completion latch rather
  than one packaged task/future per range.
- Candidate generation stores compact `{uint32 beam index, direction}` metadata
  separately from one canonical point vector. The same index drives sampling,
  score storage, frontier reconstruction, and original-order tie behavior.
  Concrete start-point prediction sampling prepares each interpolation cube
  once and resolves only its unique chunk keys through the shared local
  resolver.
- `--lookahead-retry-parent-cap N` can retry a failed lazy-lookahead segment at
  a larger parent cap and adopt only a successful retry. It is disabled by
  default (`0`); the measured cap-32 path remains the production baseline.
- `vc_fiber_trace_metric` opens Lasagna manifests through the shared
  location-aware `vc_lasagna` dataset opener. Local manifests continue to work
  without extra arguments. Direct remote `s3://`, `s3+REGION://`, `http://`, or
  `https://` manifests require `--remote-cache-dir`; both manifest JSON and
  referenced Zarr objects are persisted and reused through their shared cache
  layers. The exact-byte manifest cache is the same generic arbitrary-file
  cache used by VC3D Open Data publication. Remote manifest fetch failures
  report the original
  location, redacted resolved URL, HTTP status or no-response marker, response
  metadata/body excerpt, and S3 region/credential-loaded status when
  applicable. Relative group `zarr` paths resolve against the manifest parent
  location, absolute local group paths stay local, and absolute remote group
  paths open as independent cached remote Zarr roots.

- 3D prefetch computes a CP-centered selected-level augmentation-envelope bbox
  and asks VC3D for authoritative bbox-to-chunk dependency metadata. This avoids
  materializing representative coordinates or reconstructing chunk paths in
  Python.
- 3D prefetch follows the 2D streaming prefetch architecture: bounded
  dependency producer workers controlled by `prefetch_sampler_workers`,
  bounded transfer workers controlled by `prefetch_workers`, immediate
  cache-hit / `.empty` / download classification, earliest-sample download
  priority, deterministic safe-prefix `idx`, and live progress while
  dependencies are still being generated. The 3D-only simplification is that
  each sample contributes one CP-centered 3D augmentation-envelope volume
  derived from configured augmentation extrema rather than one sampled
  augmentation draw; no strip-z loop, coordinate-envelope tensor, or top-view
  branch exists in 3D.
- 3D prefetch follows the 2D step-count sentinels: omitted `--prefetch-steps`
  uses `training.max_steps`; positive values override config; explicit
  `--prefetch-steps 0` means every selected training CP once; negative values
  are rejected. When `training.max_sample_index` is positive, the prefetched
  training prefix is bounded to that deterministic data prefix. When held-out
  `test_datasets` are configured and full/config-driven prefetch is requested,
  the test CPs are prefetched once in flat order with test augmentations
  disabled unless explicitly enabled.

The important behavior is:

- read VC3D fiber JSONs or NML fiber annotations plus Lasagna manifests;
- select deterministic control-point samples;
- build VC3D-equivalent side-strip coordinate grids;
- sample image values through the VC3D blocking coordinate sampler;
- optionally apply coordinate-space geometric augmentation and torch value
  augmentation;
- train a small 2D direction model using CP-local Lasagna two-cos-channel
  direction targets;
- optionally train a sheet/fiber-presence head from transformed CP pixels and
  reachable non-CP pixels;
- optionally train a second top-view direction plus distance-transform model
  from VC3D-style top-strip slices;
- optionally train a CP-local contrastive embedding head using cosine
  similarity;
- export JPG batches and augmentation contact sheets for inspection;
- prefetch addressed base-volume chunks into the configured cache.

## Module Map

`fiber_json.py`

- Re-exports the existing VC3D fiber JSON parser from
  `vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace.fiber_json`.
- Keeps control-point and line-point parsing semantics shared with the existing
  3D fiber trace code.
- Adds NML parsing for Knossos/WebKnossos `<thing>` graphs. NML nodes are
  ordered by `<edge>` connectivity; each open simple path component is
  normalized into one `Vc3dFiber`. Branching, closed, malformed, or singleton
  components are skipped or rejected with diagnostics instead of being guessed.
- Provides a shared `load_fiber_file` entrypoint that returns one or more
  normalized `Vc3dFiber` objects for `.json` or `.nml` sources.

`strip_geometry.py`

- Defines `FiberStripFrame`, `FiberStripGrid`, and `FiberStripLineWindow`.
- Locates the CP-local line window that can affect a requested strip width.
- Requires each selected control point to be an exact member of `line_points`;
  mismatch is treated as corrupt fiber data.
- Ports the VC3D/Lasagna side-strip frame construction:
  - tangent from neighboring line points;
  - mesh normal from Lasagna normals projected into the tangent plane;
  - side direction from normal x tangent;
  - frame transport and roll smoothing along the local line window.
- Builds explicit coordinate grids for side strips using cubic Hermite
  interpolation over line arc length.
- Provides a torch-vectorized dense grid builder,
  `build_side_strip_patch_grid_tensor_from_line_window`, which keeps the same
  frame semantics but vectorizes per-pixel interpolation work and returns torch
  tensors on the requested device. The older
  `build_side_strip_patch_grid_from_line_window_torch` wrapper remains a
  NumPy-returning compatibility boundary.
- The dense grid also exposes the per-pixel strip offset axis so nearby
  strip-z patches can be derived from one CP-local source grid.

`loader_support.py`

- Contains small Zarr-array helpers used by the fallback/manual sampling path.
- Computes chunk requests for explicit trilinear coordinate samples.
- Provides `sample_array_trilinear` for fake/local-array tests.
- Uses the shared `vesuvius.neural_tracing.zarr_support` compatibility boundary
  for store-relative chunk keys. That boundary uses Zarr 2's array/store APIs
  or Zarr 3's metadata encoder and synchronous store API while preserving the
  same v2 slash-separated cache keys and raw bytes.

`sampling.py`

- Defines the `CoordinateSampler` interface used by the loader.
- `CoordinateSampler.sample_coord_batch` loads a stack of coordinate patches
  and returns `[patches,H,W]` image and valid-mask arrays. The default
  implementation flattens `[patches,H,W,3]` into one larger coordinate image,
  calls ordinary `sample_coords` once, and reshapes back.
- `CoordinateSampler.sample_block_zyx` loads a regular axis-aligned
  selected-level `[D,H,W]` block and returns the same image/valid/stats
  contract. Native 3D Trace2CP uses this for inference blocks so it does not
  build dense coordinate grids for ordinary cubes.
- `Vc3dCoordinateSampler` is the production sampler:
  - opens local paths with `vc.volume.Volume.open`;
  - converts `s3://bucket/key` to the matching public HTTPS URL;
  - opens remote paths with `Volume.open_url`;
  - calls `Volume.sample_coords(..., blocking=True)` so requested-level chunks
    are fetched/decoded and pinned before sampling starts;
  - calls `Volume.sample_zyx_block(..., blocking=True)` for regular
    axis-aligned block reads used by native 3D Trace2CP;
  - rejects blocking results that do not report strict requested-level sampling
    (`requested_level_only=true`, `fallback_levels=0`);
  - uses `Volume.collect_coords_dependencies(...)` for prefetch dependency
    discovery, without sampling image values;
  - exposes VC3D persistent-cache data and `.empty` marker paths for Python
    prefetch classification.
- `NumpyZarrCoordinateSampler` remains useful for tests and local fake arrays.
- `make_coordinate_sampler` currently returns the VC3D sampler for normal
  runtime.

`augmentation.py`

- Defines `FiberStripAugmentConfig` and `FiberStripAugmentParams`.
- Builds geometric augmentation maps in strip pixel coordinates. The image is
  never geometrically warped after loading; instead, output pixels map into an
  oversized source coordinate grid, and final 3D coordinates are sampled once.
- Training, augment-vis, line tracing, Trace2CP, labels, TTA, and core loader
  paths keep geometric image-space augmentation helpers absent. Any geometric
  change on those paths must be represented as coordinate manipulation before
  sampling/slicing the patch. Only value-only image changes such as brightness,
  contrast, gamma, noise, and blur run after image sampling. The runner's
  `--dir-vis` mode is the only diagnostic exception: it applies pixel-perfect
  image-space flips and 90-degree rotations to an already sampled center patch
  for checkpoint robustness inspection.
- Provides `StripAugmentTransform`, the shared paired transform for geometric
  augmentation. At construction it bakes the whole geometric stack into two
  concrete tensors: `backward_map_xy` maps output pixels to source pixels for
  image/coordinate sampling, and `forward_map_xy` maps source pixels to output
  pixels for line/CP lookup. Runtime point mapping samples these cached maps; it
  does not re-run affine/smooth formulas or invert one direction from the
  other.
- Exposes torch-native transformed line/control-point coordinate helpers for
  loader internals, with NumPy wrappers kept for public/debug callers.
- Affine shift is composed as an output-space translation after scale/flip, and
  the inverse sampling grid plus transformed line/control-point coordinates use
  that same order.
- Implements affine transforms, flips, smooth row offsets, value augmentation,
  line-coordinate mapping, and debug line overlays. Smooth line/CP mapping uses
  bilinear lookup against the prebuilt `forward_map_xy`; smooth interpolation is
  only used while constructing the maps.
- Provides a batched sparse bilinear gather for line/CP point lookup. Training
  batch construction stacks `forward_map_xy` tensors across strip-z offsets and
  avoids tiny sparse `grid_sample` calls.
- Loader patch construction reuses one transform object for coordinate
  augmentation and line/CP mapping. Line points and the CP are mapped together
  in one batched source-to-output call, and shared line/CP results can be reused
  across strip-z offsets with identical augmentation params.
- The loader also exposes coordinate-sampled TTA builders for runner
  inspection. They start from a base patch's `coords_zyx`, transform those
  coordinates through the same augmentation maps, sample the volume at the
  transformed coordinates, and return both the output-to-reference
  `source_xy_grid` and the reference-to-output map. Median-TTA tracing uses the
  reference-to-output map to locate a reference trace point inside a TTA field
  in constant time, then uses `source_xy_grid` to map sampled TTA directions
  back to the reference frame.
- Training `build_sample` batches compatible strip-z offset coordinate
  augmentation by stacking `backward_map_xy` tensors and running dense
  coordinate/valid-mask sampling over the stack. It then sends the whole
  strip-z stack through `CoordinateSampler.sample_coord_batch`, so normal VC3D
  loading is one flattened coordinate-sampling call per CP sample instead of
  one call per strip-z offset.
- Value augmentation runs as torch tensor operations on the configured device:
  brightness, contrast, gamma, noise, and separable Gaussian blur. Training
  `build_sample` applies value augmentation to the loaded image stack, while
  retaining per-patch noise seeds and blur parameters. Batched value
  augmentation applies variable per-patch Gaussian blur with grouped
  convolutions so CUDA training does not launch one blur convolution pair per
  patch.
- Debug line overlays are drawn only as the final visualization step. The line
  coordinates themselves are transformed geometrically, not raster-warped.

`direction.py`

- Implements the Lasagna ambiguous two-cos-channel strip direction encoding:
  `0.5 + 0.5*cos(2*theta)` and `0.5 + 0.5*cos(2*theta + pi/4)`.
- Builds V0 training targets from transformed strip-line coordinates.
- Selects only the eight neighboring pixels around the rounded transformed CP
  location, filtered by valid image samples.
- Decodes predicted direction channels with Lasagna's analytic inverse:
  recover `cos(2*theta)` and `sin(2*theta)` from the two channels, then use
  `atan2(...)/2`. There is no binned candidate-angle lookup decoder.

`model.py`

- Defines `FiberStripDirectionNet`, the V0 2D residual CNN.
- The default model has 10 residual blocks and 64 hidden channels.
- The default normalization is `BatchNorm2d`.
- Consumes flattened strip patches shaped `[patch_batch, 1, height, width]`.
- Outputs two per-pixel direction channels in the Lasagna encoded
  representation first. If enabled, one sigmoid sheet/fiber-presence channel
  follows. Contrastive embedding channels are appended after direction and any
  presence channel only when contrastive training/inference is explicitly
  configured with embedding channels.
- The same network class is also reused for the optional top-view auxiliary
  model. In that layout the scalar sigmoid head is interpreted as a
  fiber-center distance transform rather than side-strip presence.

`loader.py`

- Parses Vesuvius-style JSON configs into `FiberStrip2DConfig`.
- Opens the base volume and Lasagna manifest channels.
- Validates selected base-volume shape against the Lasagna manifest shape.
- Skips any fiber whose control points are outside the manifest/base-volume
  bounds.
- Builds a compact in-RAM fiber-line geometry store at loader startup. The
  loader first computes CP source-window line-index ranges, samples Lasagna
  normals only for those required ranges with batched channel reads, creates
  valid frame intervals, and shares compact line/frame arrays read-only by
  loader clones and threaded workers in the same process. Startup record
  construction uses process workers when `loader_workers > 1`; each process
  opens its own base-volume and Lasagna handles, returns compact geometry, and
  the parent assembles the single shared store in original record order.
- Builds one CP source strip from the compact geometry store with the
  torch-vectorized augment-vis path, then derives all configured strip-z
  offsets from that source using the stored strip offset axis.
- Can derive one top-view patch per loaded CP sample with
  `load_top_batch_for_batch`. That path uses the same VC3D-style top-strip
  `lineSurface` coordinate construction as Trace2CP visualization and reuses
  the CP sample's deterministic geometric/value augmentation parameters. Its
  source geometry uses the same compact geometry store as side-view source
  construction. Runtime preparation mirrors the side-view path: batched
  augmentation maps, batched coordinate resampling, and grouped
  `CoordinateSampler.sample_coord_batch` calls. The transformed line and CP
  pixel coordinates are reused from the center side-strip sample because those
  pixel-frame coordinates are identical for the same augmentation.
- Does not use a persistent dense strip-coordinate cache. The old
  `strip_coord_cache_dir` config key is rejected; dense source coordinates are
  generated from compact in-RAM frame arrays and then discarded after the
  batch/source consumer no longer needs them.
- Keeps source grids, strip-z offset grids, geometric coordinate augmentation,
  and transformed line/control-point coordinates as torch tensors until an
  explicit consumer needs NumPy.
- Converts final coordinates and validity masks to contiguous CPU NumPy once
  immediately before VC3D `sample_coords` or dependency discovery; runner/sample
  metadata converts line and control-point coordinates at assembly/export time.
- Builds one sample as all configured strip-z offsets around one control point.
- Builds a batch by stacking deterministic samples.
- Uses the bounded data index only for CP/data selection; when training wraps a
  bounded `max_sample_index` prefix, augmentation parameters are seeded by the
  unbounded stream index so repeated CPs do not replay the same transform.
- Builds contrastive training batches by selecting deterministic shuffled
  groups of `N` CPs from one fiber, concatenating consecutive same-fiber groups
  to fill the configured training batch, using independent geometric
  augmentation seeds per patch, and synchronizing value/image augmentation
  seeds within each group.
- Implements `build_strip_source` / `build_strip_patch_from_source` as the
  shared path for training, runner loading, augment-vis, and prefetch.
- Implements `build_trace2cp_segment_patch` for runner inspection of a segment
  between two control points in the same fiber. This path resolves the start CP
  from the deterministic sample stream, validates the target CP, builds a
  Lasagna/VC3D-style side-strip segment covering both CPs plus margin, and
  samples the center strip-z image through the normal coordinate sampler. The
  returned segment sample carries the original line indices and signed Lasagna
  normals used for that strip, plus the actual start/target strip row-axis
  vectors after frame construction. Whole-fiber Trace2CP can pass a shared-CP
  row-axis reference into this path so adjacent pair-local strips keep the same
  vertical row orientation despite Lasagna normal sign ambiguity.
- Implements a shared Trace2CP source builder from explicit
  `FiberStripLineWindow` points and Lasagna normals. Original CP-pair sources,
  2D iterative refinement, and native 3D regenerated strips all call this same
  low-level side-strip grid construction.
- Implements `build_trace2cp_volume_trace_segment_source` for native 3D
  regenerated/fused strips. It accepts actual base-volume XYZ trace points,
  samples fresh Lasagna normals at those points, and builds a new side/top strip
  source without using the original source strip grid as a validity domain.
- Implements `build_trace2cp_refined_segment_source` for the older 2D iterative
  refinement API. It remains a compatibility adapter from prior source-strip
  `(x,y,z)` coordinates into volume-space points, then calls the shared builder.
  The synthetic line keeps endpoint context on both sides of the CP pair so the
  next pass behaves like an independent Trace2CP run on a new line source. This
  path samples the volume again for the next pass; it does not warp the previous
  image.
- Computes prefetch envelopes from the same shared source geometry, asks the
  sampler for dependency-only chunk requests, deduplicates those requests, and
  fetches only chunks not already represented in the VC3D persistent cache.
- Keeps `build_augmented_center_strip_source` as a compatibility wrapper for
  the runner contact sheet.

`runner.py`

- Provides the command-line entry point:

  ```bash
  python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_2d.runner
  ```

- Loads a config, optionally prefetches chunks, loads a batch, exports JPGs, and
  exports augmentation contact sheets.
- Non-prefetch runner/debug patch loading uses the configured `augment_device`
  for torch coordinate generation. With `augment_device: "auto"`, CUDA is used
  when available. Prefetch dependency generation is intentionally CPU-only.
- Its prefetch mode is sample-count oriented:
  `--prefetch --prefetch-samples <control-point-samples>`.
- `--augment-profile` enables augment-visualization timing rows with cold and
  warm passes, full total/average-per-patch summaries, and no-first
  total/average summaries for warm-path timing.
- Provides `--line-trace-vis --checkpoint <snapshot> --export-dir <dir>` for
  V0.1 patch line-tracing inspection. This mode loads the deterministic
  center side-strip patch for `--sample-index`, runs the checkpointed direction
  model, bilinearly traces the decoded direction field from the transformed CP
  in both directions with a default 4 px trace step and a default receptive
  field margin of `model_depth`, and writes
  `line_trace_vis.jpg` plus `line_trace_summary.txt`.
- The line-trace JPG normally has two columns: the unaugmented trace view, then
  the original patch with a flock of traces from random combined geometric
  training-style test-time augmentations mapped back through each TTA
  output-to-reference coordinate grid. `--line-trace-tta-count` controls the
  TTA count and defaults to 100.
- `--line-trace-vis --med-tta` adds a third column. That trace stays in the
  original patch space and uses the same random TTA direction fields as the
  flock column. At each step it samples the reference and TTA direction fields,
  maps the current original-patch point into each TTA field through the
  prebuilt reference-to-output map, maps TTA orientations back to the original
  patch frame through the output-to-reference coordinate grid, resolves the
  ambiguous direction sign against the previous step, and steps along the
  normalized median direction.
- Provides `--trace2cp-vis --checkpoint <snapshot> --export-dir <dir>` for
  trace-to-next-control-point inspection. This mode resolves `--sample-index`
  through the deterministic sample order, uses that CP as the start, targets
  the next CP by default, and can use `--trace2cp-target-offset` or
  `--trace2cp-target-cp-index` for other same-fiber target CPs.
- `--trace2cp-vis --fiber-json <path>` runs the same Trace2CP path for every
  in-range CP pair in an explicit fiber. Before constructing the loader, the
  runner narrows a single-dataset config to `fiber_paths=[<path>]`, so the
  command loads only that fiber while keeping the same Lasagna manifest,
  volume scale, cache, and sampler context as normal training/inspection. With
  the default target offset `1`, pairs are adjacent CPs. This mode writes
  `trace2cp_fiber_vis.jpg` and `trace2cp_fiber_summary.txt`; it does not write
  the single-pair `trace2cp_vis.jpg`. Invalid pair segments, for example from
  zero Lasagna `grad_mag` samples in the local line window, are skipped and
  listed in the summary; the command fails only if no valid pairs remain.
- `--trace2cp-vis` loads a side-strip segment spanning both CPs, runs the same
  decoded direction-field model as line tracing, traces start-to-target and
  target-to-start on the same strip, and reports the public
  `trace2cp_error`: the mean y error at the opposite CP x-columns divided by
  the horizontal start-to-target CP span. The forward trace is compared at the
  target CP column; the reverse trace is compared at the start CP column. When
  a target-directed step crosses the opposite CP column, the trace appends an
  exact interpolated point at that column before metric computation. If a
  target-directed trace exhausts `max_steps`, the runner raises a visible error
  instead of scoring a missing target-column fallback. The center-biased
  closest approach remains a `refine_score` diagnostic for the fused/optimized
  visualization rows only. The trace2cp segment strip uses eight times the
  configured patch height for more vertical room before the RF margin.
- `--trace2cp-refine-iterations N` runs additional Trace2CP passes after the
  initial pass. Each pass smooths the previous selected fused trace with a
  finite Gaussian kernel controlled by `--trace2cp-refine-smooth-window`
  (default `5`), preserves the CP endpoints and x columns, builds a new
  volume-sampled side strip from the smoothed trace with endpoint context
  before/after the CP pair, and reruns the same scoring mode. Single-pair mode
  keeps `trace2cp_vis.jpg` for pass 0 and writes `trace2cp_vis_it1.jpg`,
  `trace2cp_summary_it1.txt`, etc. Whole-fiber mode similarly writes
  `trace2cp_fiber_vis_it1.jpg` and `trace2cp_fiber_summary_it1.txt`.
- Trace2CP uses `--med-tta` to decide whether to use TTA. Without it, the tool
  traces and scores both directions on the base direction field. With it,
  deterministic random geometric TTA direction fields are built by transforming
  the segment coordinate grid and sampling the volume at those coordinates.
  The TTA set uses the training geometric ranges except y-shift is forced to
  zero and scale to one. The tool then traces both median-direction lines in
  the reference segment strip, using each TTA reference-to-output coordinate
  grid for point lookup and each output-to-reference grid for direction
  mapping.
- `--trace2cp-vis --trace2cp-combined` switches the selected Trace2CP output to
  the regular stepwise candidate-fan combined tracer. It scores side direction
  at both the current/last point and candidate point, plus optional presence.
  The monotone-x DP backend is still available for experiments, but only when
  `--trace2cp-dp` is also supplied. In DP mode, the state is
  `(side_z_layer, y, prev_dy, prev_dz)`. Side DP uses fixed 4 px horizontal
  transitions, plus the exact target column. `--line-trace-step` controls
  output resampling density, not DP transition length. Direction scoring is
  angle-space: `theta = degrees(acos(abs(dot(path_tangent, direction))))`,
  then `(theta / 10)^2 * (1 + max(theta - knee, 0) / knee)`. The existing
  candidate-angle setting provides the knee, defaulting to 25 degrees; it must
  not cap global horizontal slope because valid local fibers can be steeper
  than 45 degrees.
  Transition scoring samples fractional row/z positions with bilinear
  interpolation and sign-aligns ambiguous direction-vector corners to the
  transition tangent before blending. Side DP uses no default per-step z
  movement penalty; it uses dz smoothness (`0.5 * (dz_current - dz_previous)^2`)
  to discourage abrupt z-step changes while allowing steady z motion. This
  combined path is an inspection/refinement path; the non-combined reference
  tracer remains the public target-column Trace2CP metric.
  `--trace2cp-combined-mode direction` is the only active combined mode.
  `--trace2cp-use-presence` adds `1 - sigmoid_presence` at sampled DP pixels,
  weighted by `--trace2cp-combined-presence-weight`. Embedding and image
  similarity modes are no longer active tracer modes and now fail clearly if
  requested.
  With z-search, side-model presence is read through the z-plane cache before
  scoring or display. By default this returns raw per-layer presence. Adding
  `--trace2cp-presence-blur` enables an experimental weighted Gaussian-smoothed
  stack: side-z radius 21, then a PyTorch batched direction-aligned anisotropic
  x/y gather using radius 5 along the local predicted side direction and radius
  1 across it. The x/y kernel is symmetric, so Lasagna direction sign ambiguity
  does not affect the blurred presence.
  When presence scoring is active, `trace2cp_vis.jpg` appends a fixed-scale
  presence column and whole-fiber `trace2cp_fiber_vis.jpg` appends a fixed-scale
  presence row: `0` is black, `1` is white, invalid pixels are black, and the
  fiber line, CPs, and selected traces are overlaid. With z-search, the z debug
  column also shows forward/reverse/fused z-corrected presence maps, built
  column-by-column from the same selected z layers as the z-corrected image;
  whole-fiber presence uses the fused z-corrected presence when available.
- Trace2CP visualizations also include VC3D-style top-strip output sampled
  from volume coordinates, not warped from the side-strip image. Single-pair
  `trace2cp_vis.jpg` appends a debug column and whole-fiber
  `trace2cp_fiber_vis.jpg` appends stitched rows. The first top strip is the
  original/init comparison from the segment line window and Lasagna/VC3D frames.
  The second top strip is reconstructed from the traced fused line projected to
  the central z slice: each output column samples the segment coordinate grid
  and Lasagna row-normal axis at the fused trace position, derives a side axis
  from traced tangent and row normal, then samples rows through the volume. If
  z-search is active, both modes also include a traced fused z-corrected top
  strip that uses the fused trace's per-column selected z offset along the
  side-strip out-of-plane side-z axis.
  With z-search and a side presence head, the same top-strip section appends
  side-presence z-pillar rows. Each column samples the inferred side-slice
  presence stack across z layers at the relevant trace y coordinate, so a
  `--trace2cp-z-max-layer 40` run produces 81-pixel-high z-pillar panels. These
  are side-stack projections, not true top-strip surface predictions and not
  top-model predictions; they can resemble a narrow side-presence slice when
  the side presence field is broad or similar across shifted layers. For the
  z-search fused trace panel, columns are shifted by the selected trace z layer
  so the center row is relative z=0 around the used layer.
- `--trace2cp-obj` can be added to single-pair `--trace2cp-vis` to write
  vertex-colored OBJ debug meshes under `trace2cp_obj/`. The meshes reuse the
  same sampled Trace2CP coordinate grids as the images: center side strip,
  z-search selected side-strip columns, original top strip, traced fused top
  strip, and z-corrected traced top strip when present. Separate OBJ files are
  written for volume intensity and available side-model presence values, with a
  `manifest.txt` listing vertex and face counts. This flag is intentionally not
  supported for stitched whole-fiber `--fiber-json` output yet.
- `--trace2cp-top-model-dir-vis` loads the checkpoint's top-view model and
  appends sparse predicted direction indicators over the traced fused top strip.
  It samples top-strip offsets `-4..+4` selected-scale voxels around the
  z-corrected fused trace when available, otherwise around the central-z fused
  trace. Each offset layer is inferred by the top model, and each displayed
  direction is the normalized median of valid layer directions within
  45 degrees of image-horizontal after aligning the Lasagna-ambiguous signs.
  The panel also draws two equally weighted top traces through that fused
  direction field, from each CP toward the other CP's x column. Those traces
  resolve ambiguous direction signs before bilinear interpolation by flipping
  each of the four neighboring pixel direction samples, if needed, to agree
  with the current trace direction. The same panel also draws a monotone-x
  dynamic-programming path from CP column to CP column on the top-strip center
  row. That path uses `(top_offset_layer, y, prev_dy, prev_dz)` state, can move
  between neighboring top-offset layers with a `0.1 * abs(delta_layer)`
  transition penalty, adds second-order smoothness penalties
  that default to zero, uses fixed 8 px horizontal transitions, and integrates
  `1 - abs(dot(path_tangent, layer_direction))` across each transition's
  crossed pixel columns using fractional row/z interpolation from the direction
  field. It uses no absolute-y row bias by default, and uses a fixed penalty,
  rather than a hard stop, for invalid/missing direction
  pixels. The visualization also appends diagnostics derived from the DP
  optimized line: an optimized top strip resliced around the DP top-row path
  and selected top-offset layers, a side slice reconstructed from the combined
  top-row plus selected-layer side displacement, and top z-pillar/side-column
  presence panels when side-model presence exists. The optimized top-strip
  panel draws the optimized line as the straight slice center. Side/presence
  panels use a visualization z-plane cache sized to that combined optimized
  side displacement, not just the raw selected top-offset layer range.
  Z-corrected debug helpers lazily infer the requested z-plane layers instead
  of assuming `plane_cache.layers` is already complete. These panels are
  diagnostic only and do not change scoring or z-layer selection.
- `--trace2cp-side-top-z-experiment` adds a separate single-pair diagnostic
  path. It is exclusive: when this flag is set, the command writes only
  `trace2cp_side_top_z_experiment.jpg`,
  `trace2cp_side_top_z_summary.txt`, and the local top-slice debug
  directories; it does not run the normal Trace2CP overlay/refinement chain or
  write `trace2cp_vis.jpg`. It uses the regular side candidate fan scoring for side x/y steps: side
  directions are interpolated at both the current/last point and candidate
  point from the current z-layer prediction with ambiguity-aware two-cos
  direction handling, and optional presence is scored when
  `--trace2cp-use-presence` is active. It carries a bounded selected-scale
  z/offset state, but top-model inference is run only once after a side
  candidate has been accepted. That per-step top patch updates only the
  z/lateral state; embedding/image scores and DP are not part of this
  diagnostic. The top patch is centered at the accepted traced side point. Its
  x axis is derived from the sampled side-view direction by tilting the
  side-strip tangent within the tangent/normal plane, and its second in-plane
  axis remains the side-strip lateral axis; this avoids optimizing roll around
  the fiber line. The top direction is an ambiguity-aligned weighted median
  over a normally weighted local neighborhood, default radius 20 px. Outputs
  are `trace2cp_side_top_z_experiment.jpg` and
  `trace2cp_side_top_z_summary.txt`. The experiment JPG is intentionally
  compact: it shows only forward/backward z-corrected side traces,
  forward/backward z-corrected presence, the input top strip, and the
  forward/backward z-corrected traced top strips, without per-step
  top-direction ticks. It also writes every local top slice used during the
  stepwise z update to
  `trace2cp_side_top_z_top_slices/`, plus native-size direction overlays to
  `trace2cp_side_top_z_top_overlays/`, with `fw_####.jpg` and `bw_####.jpg`
  names. The trace state is kept as floating-point xyz positions; z-layer
  rounding is only used when selecting side prediction layers or reconstructing
  display columns. During the slow repeated local top-patch inference loop,
  forward and backward traces print throttled `trace2cp side_top_z progress`
  rows with a small bar, accepted step count, top-patch counts, current z,
  elapsed time, ETA, and the final reason.
- `--trace2cp-vis --trace2cp-combined --trace2cp-z-search` runs the same
  regular stepwise z-search over side-strip z layers by default. Each accepted
  candidate-fan step may choose the current or neighboring z layer. Adding
  `--trace2cp-dp` switches the z-search to the experimental monotone DP over a
  bounded z-layer stack. The loader builds one aligned Trace2CP segment source
  from the CP-to-CP line window and Lasagna normals. In that side strip, image
  x follows the fiber tangent, image y follows the Lasagna row-normal axis, and
  z-search layers move along the out-of-plane frame side axis. State layer `k`
  represents `k * --trace2cp-z-step-voxels` selected-scale voxels along that
  axis. Inference is capped at one selected-scale voxel spacing: z steps of
  `1.0` or larger sample each requested state directly, while sub-voxel steps
  infer only bracketing integer side-z offsets and interpolate direction and
  optional presence fields for the requested state. Direction interpolation
  sign-aligns the ambiguous vectors before interpolation and normalizes the
  result. The default z step is `1.0` selected-scale voxel, with a bounded
  range controlled by `--trace2cp-z-max-layer`. Z-search never warps an
  already sampled image and never rebuilds unrelated planes. Direction and
  optional presence costs are sampled from the selected state layer at each
  step/transition.
- Single-pair z-search visualization appends a z column with separate forward,
  reverse, and fused z-corrected views plus a fused z-layer map row. These
  images are reconstructed per column by rounding the trace/fused z value to
  the nearest z-search state layer and copying that state's sampled image
  column. With sub-voxel z steps, interpolated states reuse the nearest
  integer-inferred side-z image. Columns outside the available trace/fused z
  path render black. This visualization does not re-sample the volume and does
  not interpolate image values between z layers.
- `--trace2cp-z-layers-tif` can be added to z-search Trace2CP runs to export
  the inferred layer cache as multilayer TIFF. Single-pair mode writes
  `trace2cp_z_layers.tif`; whole-fiber mode writes one pair-local TIFF per
  valid pair under `trace2cp_z_layers/`. Page order is all sampled slice images
  in sorted inferred z-layer order, followed by all available presence maps in
  the same sorted inferred z-layer order. With sub-voxel z steps, this export
  writes the actual integer-inferred layers, not the interpolated state layers.
- When embedding channels are present, single-pair `trace2cp_vis.jpg` appends a
  debug column of fixed-scale cosine similarity maps: start CP, target CP,
  same-fiber CP-bank/global similarity when a combined Trace2CP bank is
  available, forward trace-progress last-point columns, and reverse
  trace-progress last-point columns. The forward/reverse panels paint the
  column band around each newly placed trace point using the previous accepted
  trace point's embedding; the band radius is `ceil(step_px / 2)`, and
  unvisited columns render black. The column is for inspection only and does
  not affect Trace2CP scoring or metrics.
- `--trace2cp-vis --med-tta --vis-tta` writes `trace2cp_tta/reference.jpg`,
  one `trace2cp_tta/random_NNN.jpg` per generated TTA field, and
  `trace2cp_tta/contact_sheet.jpg`. Each image shows the sampled slice with the
  transformed base-strip corner outline and start/target CP markers.
- Trace2CP writes `trace2cp_vis.jpg`, writes `trace2cp_summary.txt`, and prints
  the selected public metric as a standalone first stdout line:
  `trace2cp_error=<value>`. A second `trace2cp details ...` line carries
  diagnostics such as target-column raw y error in pixels, horizontal CP span,
  `refine_score`, trace mode, endpoint diagnostics, and per-direction
  scores/statuses. The summary includes metric target-column interpolation
  values, the refinement closest x position, fused/optimized point counts,
  forward/reverse raw endpoint errors, normalized endpoint scores, target
  x-columns, target-column reach statuses, termination reasons, and trace point
  counts. The JPG is a labeled vertical stack with full traces, partial
  closest-approach traces, the fused CP-to-CP line, and the optimized
  refinement. With `--med-tta`, that stack is rendered as the first column and
  a second column shows the reference-only/base-inference result without TTA.
  With `--trace2cp-combined`, the selected combined stack is rendered alongside
  the reference-only/base-inference stack and the summary/stdout include
  candidate settings, weights, embedding-bank size/skips, and mean score
  components without duplicating the selected public metric label. Trace2CP
  stdout also ends with a compact timing table. Single-pair mode prints
  `trace2cp timings`; whole-fiber mode prints `trace2cp fiber timings`
  aggregated across valid pairs. Each row is one stage with count, total,
  mean, and max milliseconds for source sampling, inference, tracing, debug
  rendering, and file-output stages. Slow Trace2CP DP solves emit
  time-throttled `trace2cp dp ...` progress rows only when the explicit DP
  backend is selected; progress rows include solved columns, elapsed seconds,
  and `eta_s`.
  CLI side, side-z, and top-model DP calls use a torch-vectorized backend on
  the active model device. The column recurrence remains sequential, but each
  column is computed with tensor operations over all layers/rows and move
  chunks. Direct helper calls without a torch device still use the NumPy
  fallback. Side-z DP also caps the inferred layer stack to the center-anchored
  reachable range. The candidate-angle setting is the angle-space penalty knee,
  not a global side-DP move-lattice cap.
- The whole-fiber Trace2CP JPG is composed after pair scoring. Pair-local
  images and traced points are mapped into a shared fiber arc-length x
  coordinate system using each pair's local start/target CP columns and global
  start/target arc-length columns. Whole-fiber mode aligns each segment's
  actual strip row axis against already accepted shared-CP row axes before
  image sampling, so adjacent pair images do not randomly flip in y.
  Valid overlapping image pixels are averaged with dense rectangular masks for
  display, and the long strip uses the same four rows as the single-pair
  Trace2CP view: full traces, partial closest-approach traces, fused CP-to-CP
  line, and optimized line. It then appends the original/init top strip, the
  traced fused top strip projected to central z, and with z-search also appends
  the traced fused z-corrected top strip. If side presence is available, it
  appends side-presence z-pillar rows for the same trace variants. The summary
  includes requested, valid, and skipped pair counts plus mean/min/max
  trace2cp errors.
  Stdout prints the public whole-fiber metric on its own line as
  `trace2cp_error_mean=<value>`;
  `trace2cp_fiber_debug.txt` records per-pair strip CP vectors, row axes,
  frame vectors, and projected CP deltas for debugging.
- Provides `--dir-vis --checkpoint <snapshot> --export-dir <dir>` for
  direction-field inspection. This mode loads the same deterministic center
  side-strip patch, applies pixel-perfect image-space identity/flip/90-degree
  rotation variants, runs the checkpointed direction model for each variant,
  nearest-neighbor scales each augmented patch image by 4x for visualization
  only, and writes a single `dir_vis.jpg` natural-size horizontal strip with one
  shared top label band and anti-aliased 6-display-pixel direction segments
  drawn every second source pixel, i.e. one segment per 8x8 display-pixel cell.
  Model inference runs on each native-resolution augmented patch before display
  upsampling. If the loaded center patch is not square, dir-vis center-crops it
  to the largest square before applying pixel-space flips/rotations; it does not
  rescale the native patch before inference. The valid mask gates model
  normalization and arrow placement, but does not black out display pixels.
  `--dbg-dirs` adds a second row: the first cell is the raw unaugmented patch
  without direction arrows, and the remaining cells run inference on transformed
  patches whose center half-image region has been overwritten with the matching
  unaugmented center crop.

`train.py`

- Provides the command-line entry point:

  ```bash
  python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_2d.train
  ```

- Loads the same JSON config as the runner, then reads a `training` section for
  optimizer, logging, and snapshot settings.
- Builds batches with `FiberStrip2DLoader`, so production training uses the
  same VC3D blocking sampler and coordinate-space augmentation path as
  augment-vis.
- Supports `--prefetch` for training-oriented prefetch-only runs. This maps
  training steps to deterministic control-point sample ranges, calls loader
  prefetch, and exits before model, optimizer, TensorBoard, run-directory, or
  snapshot setup.
- Supports `--benchmark` for a 100-batch training-work benchmark that skips
  test evaluation, TensorBoard, run-directory creation, and snapshots. It
  reports throughput as CNN image patches per second, where patches are the
  flattened `[control point, strip-z offset]` images sent through the model.
- Supports `--profile` on the benchmark path. It prints per-batch rows and a
  final milliseconds-per-patch summary for aggregate coordinate generation,
  descriptor lookup, strip-coordinate cache load, source geometry generation,
  line-coordinate generation, coordinate augmentation, base-volume sampling,
  torch value augmentation, pipeline wait time, forward plus loss, and backward
  plus optimizer step. Loader-side stage timings come from
  the shared `load_batch` / `build_strip_source` / `build_strip_patch_from_source`
  profile hooks, so profiling uses the same sampling path as normal training.
- Supports `--load-only` on the benchmark path. It still performs deterministic
  CP selection, CP-local source construction, coordinate augmentation, and
  base-volume sampling, but skips value/image augmentation, normalization,
  supervision construction, model forward, backward, and optimizer work. When
  `training.pipeline_enabled` is true, load-only benchmark mode also uses the
  bounded whole-batch queue so independent batch-load parallelism can be
  measured without model work.
- Flattens `[control_point_sample, strip_z_offset]` into one patch batch for the
  model.
- Computes direction targets from transformed line coordinates after geometric
  augmentation.
- When `training.presence_enabled` is true, configures a one-channel
  sheet/fiber-presence head and adds a balanced BCE loss: the rounded
  transformed CP pixel in each strip patch is positive, valid reachable non-CP
  pixels are negative, and unreachable shift-margin edges are ignored.
- Standard training uses direction supervision plus the optional sheet/fiber
  presence head. The standard example config enables presence and leaves
  contrastive embedding disabled.
- When `training.top_view_enabled` is true, training jointly builds one
  top-view patch per CP sample and trains a second model. The top model's
  direction loss uses the same transformed-line tangent target as side strips.
  Its scalar head is trained as a distance transform along the rounded
  cross-fiber line through the transformed CP: `1.0` at the CP, linearly down
  to `0.0` at `training.top_view_dt_radius_px`, and explicit zero targets
  beyond that radius.
- When `training.contrastive_enabled` is true, configures an embedding head,
  uses the loader's same-fiber grouped batch path, and adds a cosine embedding
  loss. Positive terms operate on rounded transformed CP pixels: for each
  anchor CP sample/strip-z offset, only other CPs from the same fiber are
  considered, across their loaded strip-z offsets, and the already most-similar
  candidate is trained toward cosine similarity `1`. Negative terms compare
  each positive to one deterministic valid non-CP pixel from the batch inside
  the CP-neighborhood reachable region derived from `augment_shift_x/y`, so
  unreachable patch edges are ignored rather than trained as always-negative.
  CP embeddings from other fibers are not used as contrastive negatives. The
  positive and valid-pixel negative means are balanced. A similarity-image
  sparsity term also compares
  the valid-pixel mean of each CP's normalized `0..1` embedding-similarity map
  over the same shift-reachable CP area against fixed target `0.1`, encouraging
  only a small reachable region to remain similar to the CP embedding. The
  balanced pair loss plus this sparsity term are multiplied by
  `training.contrastive_weight`.
- Logs `train/loss_total`, `train/loss_direction`, optional presence
  loss/components, TensorBoard presence maps, and, only when contrastive
  embedding is enabled, `train/loss_contrastive`, positive/negative
  contrastive components, and TensorBoard embedding-similarity images that
  compare every pixel in a selected patch against that patch's CP embedding.
- When top-view training is enabled, logs top-view direction/angle/DT scalars
  and TensorBoard images for the top-view line plus predicted direction and the
  top-view DT scalar map.
- On CUDA training runs, uses a bounded deterministic whole-batch pipeline when
  `training.pipeline_enabled` is true. Background workers build exact training
  steps with `FiberStrip2DLoader.load_batch`, defer image/value augmentation,
  prepare tensors on side CUDA streams, and return prepared batches for strict
  in-order forward/backward consumption. Load-only benchmark mode uses the
  same whole-batch queue without CUDA preparation.
  Coordinate generation and geometric coordinate augmentation remain on the
  configured `augment_device`.
- `training.pipeline_depth` controls queued future batches.
  `training.pipeline_workers` controls concurrent load+prepare tasks; `0`
  means use `pipeline_depth`. Completion may be out of order, but consumption
  remains ordered by training step.
- Logs scalars/images to TensorBoard and writes `current.pt` / `best.pt`
  snapshots under the run directory.
- When `test_datasets` is configured, evaluates a deterministic held-out test
  set at `training.test_interval` using either the configured fixed-size
  random window or all held-out CPs when `test_control_points` is `0`; it also
  evaluates Trace2CP on each selected held-out CP using the segment to the next
  CP. Fiber3d current/retained snapshots are written only on aligned test
  steps, and `best.pt` uses the lowest dense `test/loss_total`; Trace2CP is
  diagnostic only.
- `--resume <snapshot.pt>` restores model and optimizer state, creates a fresh
  timestamped run directory from the current config just like normal training,
  and continues from `checkpoint_step + 1`. `training.max_steps` remains the
  absolute target step, so increase it before resuming a completed finite run.
  The current config's `training.learning_rate` and `training.weight_decay`
  override checkpoint optimizer param-group values after load, while AdamW
  moment buffers and step counters are preserved. The first resumed step is
  logged and flushed to TensorBoard immediately.

`configs/loader_example.json`

- Example local Staticsheep config using:
  - PHercParis4 78keV masked base volume through the public Vesuvius S3 path;
  - local Lasagna manifest;
  - 64x64 strips;
  - one strip-z offset for CP-only training experiments;
  - measured load-only tuning with 4 whole-batch workers, queue depth 16, and
    4 CP-prep workers;
  - current augmentation extrema.

`configs/train_s1a_nml_all.json`

- S1A NML training config whose `datasets` entry uses
  `/home/hendrik/business/aiconsulting/vesuviuschallenge/data/train_fibers/fiber_vols/fibers_s1a_*.nml`.
- Loads all matching S1A NML files as the training dataset. It intentionally
  omits `test_datasets`; add a separate S1A held-out config if test evaluation
  should run on a split of this source.
- Keeps the PHercParis4 78keV base volume, base-volume scale, and Lasagna
  manifest settings from the normal example config.
- Includes the existing S1A/source-to-current PHercParis4 transform from
  `/home/hendrik/business/aiconsulting/vesuviuschallenge/villa2/lasagna/configs/tifxyz_train_s3_dbg.json`:
  inline `transform` plus `transform_invert: true`.

## Config Shape

Top-level keys used by `load_config`:

- `datasets`: non-empty list of dataset entries.
- `test_datasets`: optional non-empty list of held-out dataset entries using
  the same schema as `datasets`.
- `batch_size`: number of control-point samples per loaded batch.
- `patch_shape_hw`: `[height, width]` output patch size.
- `strip_z_offset_count`: number of parallel strip-z offsets per sample.
- `strip_z_offset_step`: offset step in selected-scale voxels.
- `seed`: deterministic control-point sample seed.
- `prefetch_workers`: transfer-worker count for prefetch; values above 16 are
  allowed and are not clamped by the loader.
- `prefetch_sampler_workers`: dependency/sampler producer-worker count for
  prefetch. This limits CPU-side CP-local source generation separately from
  download concurrency. During prefetch, PyTorch CPU intra-op threads are
  temporarily forced to `1` and restored afterwards, so producer workers do not
  each expand over the full machine.
- `loader_workers`: worker count for startup compact-geometry record
  construction and CP-sample construction in `load_batch`. The default is the
  logical CPU count. Set `loader_workers: 0` to explicitly use all logical CPU
  cores from the config, or `loader_workers: 1` for serial debugging. Parallel
  startup uses worker processes that open their own volume/Lasagna handles and
  return compact geometry for parent-owned storage by original record index.
  Parallel warm batch workers evaluate candidates concurrently while accepted
  batch output remains in deterministic sample-index order. For warm
  `load_batch` work with `loader_workers > 1`, the loader keeps a lazy
  persistent thread executor and reuses it across batches; call
  `FiberStrip2DLoader.close()` to shut it down explicitly in long-lived tools
  or tests.
- `volume_cache_dir`: optional cache directory for remote volume chunks.
- `volume_cache_memory_mib`: optional per-VC3D-sampler decoded/hot cache budget
  in MiB. `null` or omission leaves VC3D's default behavior intact. Use a
  positive cap mainly when `training.pipeline_isolated_loaders` is enabled and
  each worker creates its own VC3D sampler.
- `volume_io_threads`: optional positive VC3D I/O thread count, forwarded to
  the VC3D volume binding when available.
- `volume_cache_offline`: passed to the Vesuvius Zarr cache opener.
- `volume_cache_retry_seconds`: passed to the Vesuvius Zarr cache opener.
- `strip_coord_cache_dir`: removed. CP-local dense source-coordinate files are
  no longer read or written; compact fiber-line geometry is built in RAM during
  loader construction.
- `augment_*`: parsed into `FiberStripAugmentConfig`.
- `training`: optional object used by `train.py`; ignored by the loader/debug
  runner config parser.

Training keys:

- `run_path`: parent directory for dated run directories.
- `run_name`: prefix for the run directory.
- `max_steps`: number of training steps; `0` means indefinite mode, where
  training repeats deterministic pseudo-random full-dataset CP passes.
- `max_sample_index`: optional exclusive deterministic `data_index` limit;
  `0` means unlimited. Positive values make training wrap global stream
  positions through that deterministic data prefix, so many steps can reuse a
  prefetched subset. Augmentation seeds and all other random sources still use
  the unbounded `stream_index`, so the subset is deterministic but its
  augmentations and branch-grid offsets keep changing across repeats.
- `learning_rate`: AdamW learning rate.
- `scalar_log_interval`: TensorBoard scalar/console interval.
- `tensorboard_image_interval`: TensorBoard batch-image interval.
- `checkpoint_interval`: interval for writing `snapshots/current.pt`.
- `test_interval`: interval for deterministic held-out evaluation and, when
  `test_datasets` is configured, current snapshot writes.
- `test_control_points`: number of deterministic held-out CP samples per test
  evaluation. Positive values use the deterministic random window starting at
  `test_start_sample_index`; `0` evaluates every held-out CP sample once in
  flat CP order starting at zero.
- `test_start_sample_index`: deterministic held-out sample start index.
- `control_points_per_step`: deterministic CP samples per step; default `4`.
  Training and benchmark modes require this to match top-level `batch_size`.
  Changing `strip_z_offset_count` changes the flattened CNN patch count without
  any default-shape warning.
- `contrastive_enabled`: explicitly enables experimental same-fiber
  contrastive embedding training. It defaults to false; standard training does
  not create an embedding head or loss.
- `contrastive_embedding_channels`: number of raw embedding channels appended
  after the two direction channels and optional presence channel; must be
  positive when contrastive training is enabled. A positive value is ignored
  while `contrastive_enabled` is false.
- `contrastive_control_points_per_fiber`: same-fiber CP group size `N`.
  `control_points_per_step` must be divisible by this value so the batch is an
  exact number of same-fiber CP groups.
- `contrastive_weight`: multiplier for the balanced cosine contrastive loss.
- `contrastive_negative_margin`: cosine margin for negative pairs.
  The margin applies to valid non-CP pixel negatives.
- `top_view_enabled`: enables the jointly trained top-view auxiliary model.
  The top model uses one top-strip patch per loaded CP sample and outputs
  direction plus a DT scalar channel.
- `top_view_direction_weight`: multiplier for the top-view direction MSE.
- `top_view_dt_weight`: multiplier for the top-view distance-transform MSE.
- `top_view_dt_radius_px`: pixel distance where the top-view DT target reaches
  zero; default `30.0`.
- `device`: `auto`, `cpu`, or a torch device string.
- `tensorboard_enabled`: set false for smoke tests without TensorBoard.
- `pipeline_enabled`: enables CUDA training batch pipelining and load-only
  benchmark batch pipelining; default `true`. CPU training keeps the
  synchronous path.
- `pipeline_depth`: queued whole-batch futures for the pipeline; default `16`.
- `pipeline_workers`: concurrent whole-batch loader calls for the pipeline.
  Default `8`; `0` means use `pipeline_depth`.
- `pipeline_isolated_loaders`: default `false`. The normal path shares the base
  loader and VC3D sampler/cache across whole-batch futures. `true` gives each
  pipeline worker a cloned loader with shared parsed records/order cache but a
  fresh VC3D sampler; combine this with `volume_cache_memory_mib` if the clone
  path is required.
- `model_hidden_channels` and `model_depth`: V0 ResNet size knobs. Defaults
  are 64 hidden channels and 10 residual blocks.

Training prefetch:

- `python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_2d.train config.json
  --prefetch --prefetch-steps N` prefetches the first `N` training steps and
  overrides `training.max_steps`.
- Explicit `--prefetch-steps 0` also overrides `training.max_steps` and
  prefetches every configured training CP once in deterministic pseudo-random
  order, or the `training.max_sample_index` prefix when configured, plus every
  configured `test_datasets` CP once when held-out data is present.
- Omitting `--prefetch-steps` uses `training.max_steps`; if that configured
  value is `0`, omitted prefetch also means every configured training/test CP
  once.
- `--prefetch-start-step S` starts from the 1-based training step `S`.
- For positive prefetch step counts, sample count is `effective_steps *
  training.control_points_per_step`; start sample index is `(S - 1) *
  training.control_points_per_step` in the deterministic pseudo-random stream.
- Prefetch progress prints `idx=<exclusive-index>`, the largest contiguous
  exclusive deterministic sample-index prefix whose required chunks are
  cache-complete: cache hits, known/new missing markers, or completed
  successful downloads. That value can be used as `training.max_sample_index`
  for a later run over the prefetched subset.
- Negative `--prefetch-steps` values are rejected.
- Training prefetch only fetches base-volume chunks; Lasagna manifest channels
  are opened for geometry/normal metadata but are not prefetched.
- Prefetch uses dependency-only chunk discovery and Python-side cache
  classification. It does not call the image-sampling path just to warm the
  cache.

Training benchmark/profile:

- `python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_2d.train config.json
  --benchmark` runs 100 training batches and prints a final
  `patches_per_second` summary.
- `--profile` implies the same 100-batch benchmark work and additionally prints
  table rows with milliseconds per CNN patch for:
  - `coord`: aggregate descriptor, cache, source geometry, and line-coordinate
    work;
  - `desc`: deterministic sample descriptor lookup;
  - `cache`: strip-coordinate cache lookup/load;
  - `source`: uncached CP-local line window, Lasagna normals, and strip
    coordinate grid generation;
  - `line`: transformed line/control-point coordinates;
  - `coord_aug`: coordinate-space geometric augmentation;
  - `load`: base-volume Zarr/VC3D coordinate sampling;
  - `img_aug`: torch image/value augmentation;
  - `fw`: model forward plus loss;
  - `bw_step`: backward pass plus optimizer step.
- Benchmark/profile mode intentionally does not create a run directory or write
  checkpoints.
- Add `--load-only` to isolate loader and volume-sampling cost:

  ```bash
  python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_2d.train config.json --profile --load-only
  ```

  In this mode `img_aug`, `fw`, and `bw_step` report zero because those stages
  are intentionally skipped.

Dataset entries must contain:

- `fiber_paths` or `fiber_glob`;
- `base_volume_path`;
- `base_volume_scale`;
- `lasagna_manifest_path`.

Fiber paths may point to VC3D `.json` fibers or `.nml` files. A single NML file
can contribute multiple records when it contains multiple usable simple path
components. JSON and NML sources are normalized into `Vc3dFiber` before all
sampling, caching, prefetch, training, and Trace2CP paths.

Optional dataset keys:

- `base_volume_auth_json` / `volume_auth_json`;
- `lasagna_auth_json`;
- legacy `volume_path` / `volume_scale` aliases.
- `fiber_transform_json` / `fiber_transform_json_path`: Vesuvius registration
  `transform.json` with `p_fixed = M @ p_moving` in XYZ.
- `fiber_transform`: inline XYZ affine matrix, either 3x4 or homogeneous 4x4.
- `fiber_transform_invert`: invert the selected fiber transform before
  applying it.
- `transform` / `transform_invert`: Lasagna-compatible inline aliases for
  `fiber_transform` / `fiber_transform_invert` on fiber coordinates.

Fiber transforms apply only to parsed fiber coordinates. The matrix must map
source/moving fiber XYZ coordinates into current/fixed base-volume XYZ
coordinates unless the corresponding invert flag is set. The transform is
applied once before control-point bounds checks, deterministic sample identity,
strip-coordinate cache identity, prefetch, training, and Trace2CP use the
fiber. Lasagna normals are still read from the configured current
`lasagna_manifest_path` after coordinates are transformed.

`strip_z_offsets` is intentionally rejected; use count and step.

## Dataset Construction

`FiberStrip2DLoader.__init__` validates `batch_size`, derives strip-z offsets,
opens all configured records, and counts available control points.

For each dataset entry:

1. Open the selected base-volume level through `open_zarr`.
2. Load the Lasagna manifest with the existing 3D fiber trace helpers.
3. Open level 0 of the base volume and validate it against
   `lasagna_volume.base_shape_zyx`.
4. Validate the selected base-volume level shape against the manifest-derived
   level shape.
5. Open required Lasagna channels: `grad_mag`, `nx`, and `ny`.
6. Resolve fiber paths/globs and parse each VC3D JSON or NML source.
7. Apply any dataset-level fiber-coordinate transform in XYZ.
8. Skip the whole normalized fiber if any control point is outside the
   base-volume bounds.
9. Store a `_Record` containing fiber, volume, sampler, manifest channels, and
   scale metadata.

Only control points are checked during construction. Non-control line points are
not globally sampled up front. When a CP-local strip needs normals for a local
line window, missing or invalid Lasagna samples in that local window raise a
detailed error instead of being replaced. Batch-oriented callers handle that
data-quality error differently: prefetch and training skip the invalid
deterministic sample, report the first reason, and continue with later sample
indices.

## Sample Selection

The loader uses deterministic stateless sampling by sample index:

- `_random_flat_index(sample_index)` maps the sample index into a dataset pass
  and offset within that pass;
- each pass sorts all flat control-point indices by seeded content-based random
  keys, so every configured CP appears once before the stream repeats;
- random pass orders are cached by pass index. `load_batch` prewarms the
  attempted batch window before submitting parallel CP workers so warm workers
  do not serialize on random-order construction locks;
- `_locate_flat_index` maps it back to `(record_index, control_point_index)`.

Changing max steps, batch size, or control points per step changes how much of
the stream is consumed or how indices are grouped, but not the selected control
point for a given sample index.

## Coordinate And Scale Semantics

All fiber coordinates are kept in base-volume coordinates.

`base_volume_scale` selects:

- which Zarr group/level is read;
- the patch pixel spacing used for strip coordinate construction.

For scale `s`, one output pixel advances by `2**s` base voxels. Coordinates are
passed to the VC3D sampler in base-coordinate order `(z, y, x)`; the sampler
converts them to VC3D `(x, y, z)` and provides the selected level.

`strip_z_offset_count` and `strip_z_offset_step` generate offsets centered
around zero. The default count/step yields 16 selected-scale offsets:

```text
-7, -6, ..., -1, 0, 1, ..., 8
```

Each offset is returned as a separate 2D patch in the batch tensor, but the
coordinates are derived from one CP-local source grid rather than rebuilding
the side-strip frame and line window for every offset.

## Lasagna Normal Handling

Normals are decoded through the existing Lasagna normal decoder:

```python
lasagna.omezarr_pyramid._decode_normals
```

For each requested point:

1. `grad_mag` is trilinearly sampled first and must be positive.
2. The eight neighboring `nx`/`ny` encoded normal samples are decoded.
3. The normal sign ambiguity is handled by accumulating a weighted tensor
   `normal outer normal`.
4. A principal axis is solved and oriented using the weighted hint.

This preserves the Lasagna ambiguous normal representation instead of inventing
a separate `normal_xyz` storage format.

## Batch Shapes

`load_batch` returns `FiberStrip2DBatch` with:

- `images`: `[batch, strip_z, 1, height, width]`, float32;
- `coords_zyx`: `[batch, strip_z, height, width, 3]`, float32 base coords;
- `valid_mask`: `[batch, strip_z, height, width]`, bool;
- `strip_z_offsets`: `[strip_z]`, float32;
- `control_point_indices`: `[batch]`, int32;
- `record_indices`: `[batch]`, int32;
- `fiber_paths`: one path per batch sample;
- `samples`: flat tuple of `FiberStripSample`, ordered by sample then offset;
- `cache_stats`: cache trace object returned by the existing Zarr cache tracer.

The loader builds the same CP-local source strip path used by augment-vis. When
augmentation is enabled, that source strip is oversized for the configured
augmentation envelope, output pixels map into it, the volume is sampled at final
augmented coordinates, and value augmentation is applied afterward.

For each accepted CP sample, all configured strip-z offsets are sampled through
one sampler batch call. With the current VC3D path this uses flattened explicit
coordinate sampling: the stack is reshaped into one larger 2D coordinate image
for `Volume.sample_coords(..., blocking=True)` and reshaped back afterward.
This changes request grouping, not sampled values.

Each `FiberStripSample` also stores `line_xy` and `control_point_xy` in final
output-pixel coordinates after geometric augmentation. Training labels and
debug overlays use those coordinates directly.

## V0 Training

The V0 trainer samples deterministic pseudo-random control-point groups by
step:

```text
start_sample_index = (step - 1) * training.control_points_per_step
```

Each deterministic random dataset pass visits every configured CP once and then
wraps to another deterministic pass. For finite `training.max_steps > 0`,
training stops after that many steps. For `training.max_steps = 0`, training
continues indefinitely.

The default training shape is four control-point samples times 16 strip-z
offsets, producing 64 patches. Non-default shapes are valid. `load_batch`
returns `[control_points_per_step, strip_z_offset_count, 1, H, W]`; the trainer
reshapes this to `[control_points_per_step * strip_z_offset_count, 1, H, W]`
before the CNN forward pass.
If one deterministic sample cannot build its CP-local Lasagna normal window
for data reasons such as `grad_mag == 0`, `load_batch` skips it and advances
through following deterministic sample indices until the requested number of
control-point samples is loaded.

`load_batch` can evaluate CP candidates in parallel via `loader_workers`.
Results are consumed by raw deterministic sample index, so changing
`loader_workers` should affect latency but not the accepted output sequence.
The parallel path reuses one loader-owned executor across batches instead of
creating and destroying a thread pool per training step. `loader_workers=1`
uses a direct serial path with no futures.
Whole-batch training and load-only benchmark pipelines can run several
`load_batch` calls concurrently. The default path shares loaded records and the
VC3D sampler/cache; isolated loader clones are opt-in and only duplicate the
mutable sampler handles, not fiber or Lasagna metadata.
In benchmark/profile output, `total` is batch wall time, `cpu` is whole-process
CPU time measured with `time.process_time()`, and `ctf` is `cpu / total`.
Compare `ctf` to system CPU-utilization monitors when checking whether the
process is really using cores. `wall` is real `load_batch` wall time, `work` is
summed per-candidate worker elapsed time, and `tf` is `work / wall`. The
individual stage columns remain summed worker timings under parallel loading,
so `tf` can be high even when actual process CPU usage is lower.
Cold deterministic random-order setup is included in the descriptor column;
warm batches should mostly avoid that cost.

Images are normalized per patch over valid pixels. Invalid pixels are set to
zero after normalization.

On CUDA training runs with `training.pipeline_enabled`, the trainer keeps two
overlap stages active:

- Background load+prepare workers run deterministic whole training steps
  concurrently. Each worker uses the loader's CP-level worker pool for patch
  construction and then submits deferred image/value augmentation, image
  normalization, and supervision-tensor construction on a side CUDA stream.
- The prepared image tensor stays on CUDA. The main training stream consumes
  prepared batches in step order and waits on each preparation event
  immediately before the forward pass.

`prep_submit_ms` measures only main-thread queue refill overhead. The actual
preparation work is represented by `prep_ms` and, on CUDA, `prep_gpu_ms`.
Training prints the effective pipeline enable flag, queue depth, whole-batch
loader worker count, and CP-level loader worker count once at startup.

In load-only benchmark mode, the same whole-batch queue is used when
`training.pipeline_enabled` is true, but workers stop after
`FiberStrip2DLoader.load_batch`. This isolates whether independent batch loads
can keep CPU/I/O resources busy before adding CUDA preparation or model work.

This training-only prepared-batch path avoids the runner/debug
`apply_batch_image_augmentation()` NumPy round trip. It also requests only the
CP-local tangent line needed for direction supervision and does not retain
post-sampling coordinate arrays in the returned training batch. Runner exports
and debug loader APIs still keep full transformed strip lines and coordinates.

Targets are built from `FiberStripSample.line_xy` and
`FiberStripSample.control_point_xy`, which are already transformed output-pixel
coordinates from the loader's augmentation path. The local tangent near the
transformed CP is encoded into Lasagna's ambiguous two-cos-channel format:

```text
cos2theta = (dx^2 - dy^2) / (dx^2 + dy^2 + eps)
sin2theta = 2*dx*dy / (dx^2 + dy^2 + eps)
dir0 = 0.5 + 0.5*cos2theta
dir1 = 0.5 + 0.5*(cos2theta - sin2theta)/sqrt(2)
```

Only the eight neighboring pixels around the rounded transformed CP location
are supervised. The model is not supervised on the whole line or full patch in
V0. The optimization loss is MSE in the encoded two-channel representation.
For readability, training also reports folded unoriented angular error in
degrees over the same supervised pixels.

TensorBoard output is written under:

```text
<training.run_path>/<training.run_name>_<YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS>/
```

The trainer logs:

- `config/json` as text;
- `train/loss_direction`;
- `train/angle_error_mean_deg`;
- `train/supervision_samples`;
- `timing/load_ms`;
- `timing/pipeline_wait_ms`;
- `timing/prep_enqueue_ms`;
- `timing/prep_gpu_ms`;
- `timing/prep_wait_ms`;
- `timing/prep_submit_ms`;
- cache hit/download diagnostics where available;
- `train/batch_direction_overlay` images showing the transformed centerline
  behind one short network-predicted direction segment at the transformed CP.
  The contact sheet picks one center-offset representative from each loaded
  control-point sample before filling with additional strip-z offsets.
- when `test_datasets` is configured, `test/loss_direction`,
  `test/angle_error_mean_deg`, `test/supervision_samples`,
  `test/trace2cp_error`, `test/trace2cp_raw_y_error_mean_px`,
  `test/trace2cp_segments`, `test/trace2cp_skipped_segments`, test cache
  diagnostics, and `test/batch_direction_overlay` at test evaluation steps.

Console progress prints the same loss, mean angle error in degrees,
supervision, load-time summary, and CUDA preparation timing for every step whose
deterministic control-point sample range starts before sample index 100, then
return to `training.scalar_log_interval`.

Snapshots are written under:

```text
<run_dir>/snapshots/current.pt
<run_dir>/snapshots/best.pt
```

With `test_datasets`, `current.pt` is written at step 1, every
`training.test_interval`, and the final step; `best.pt` tracks the lowest
observed averaged `test/trace2cp_error` over the effective test sample count
(`test_control_points`, or all held-out CP samples when it is `0`). Without
`test_datasets`, snapshots keep the train-only
behavior: `current.pt` follows `training.checkpoint_interval`, and `best.pt`
tracks the lowest observed training loss.

Resume an existing run:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=vesuvius/src python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_2d.train config.json --resume /path/to/run/snapshots/current.pt
```

Training writes the resumed run to a new timestamped run directory from the
current config's `training.run_path` and `training.run_name`. If that name
collides because two runs start in the same second, a numeric suffix is added.
The resumed run writes its own `snapshots/current.pt`, `snapshots/best.pt`, and
TensorBoard event file.

## Prefetch

`chunk_requests_for_sample_index` is a compatibility/test helper that derives
dependency requests from the same conservative source-envelope coordinates used
by prefetch.

`prefetch(start_sample_index, sample_count)`:

- builds the shared CP-local source once per deterministic sample index;
- derives each configured strip-z offset from that source;
- temporarily caps PyTorch CPU intra-op fanout during dependency generation so
  `prefetch_sampler_workers` is the effective generation concurrency limit;
- sends the source-envelope coordinates to `chunk_requests_for_coords`, which
  maps them to dependency-only base-volume chunk metadata;
- deduplicates globally by `(store_identity, key)`;
- may run dependency producers in parallel, but consumes their completed
  results in raw deterministic sample-index order before classifying chunks;
- treats existing VC3D persistent-cache data files as hits;
- treats existing `<cache>/level_<level>/<iz>/<iy>/<ix>.empty` files as
  known-missing hits;
- fetches only still-missing direct-source chunks with bounded Python workers,
  writes data through unique temp files followed by atomic rename, and writes
  zero-byte `.empty` markers for definitive missing chunks;
- keeps not-yet-submitted downloads in a priority queue keyed by the earliest
  raw deterministic sample index that needs each chunk. This prevents later
  dependency producers from flooding the download executor ahead of chunks that
  would advance the reported `idx` prefix. Already-active transfers are allowed
  to finish instead of being cancelled for reprioritization;
- prints sample/dependency progress only while dependency generation is still
  running, then switches to download-only progress. The live line includes
  unique chunks, cache hits, known-missing chunks, downloaded chunks, queued
  download futures, configured transfer workers, configured sampler/dependency
  producer workers, skipped samples, errors, and MiB/s. The download
  denominator counts chunks that were not cache hits or pre-existing `.empty`
  markers. While sample dependency generation is
  incomplete, download ETA extrapolates from observed chunks per sample and
  observed cache-hit/known-missing/download-needed ratios;
- reports invalid deterministic sample skips separately from download errors
  and includes the first skip reason.

For VC3D-backed remote volumes, dependency discovery returns the authoritative
remote chunk URL/key, final persistent-cache data path, `.empty` marker path,
persistent extension, and cache payload format. Python prefetch does not
reconstruct those paths. The current Python writer supports only uncompressed
direct-source chunks where the remote payload is exactly the `.bin` payload VC3D
expects; compressed, filtered, sharded, or byte-swapped payloads fail clearly
until explicit codec support is added.

Prefetch covers the configured augmentation envelope, not a single random
augmentation draw. It may fetch a conservative superset for one patch, but later
training draws within the configured extrema should be covered by the same
cached base-volume chunks. For 3D, this is implemented as a CP-centered
selected-level bbox: the prefetcher passes the bbox to VC3D
`collect_bbox_dependencies`, and VC3D returns the same authoritative metadata
used by coordinate-surface dependency discovery.

Prefetch is only for addressed base-volume image chunks. Lasagna channels are
local manifest channels in the current Staticsheep config and are not part of
the VC3D base-volume prefetch path.

## Augmentation Contact Sheet

`runner.py --augment-vis` exports one contact sheet for the center strip offset
of a deterministic sample index.

The runner builds CP-local source geometry once:

- selected record and control point;
- oversized source shape;
- CP-local line window;
- local Lasagna normals;
- torch-vectorized source strip grid.

Every contact-sheet cell then delegates to the same shared patch builder used
by training and applies its own geometric coordinate mapping before volume
sampling.

Layout:

- row 1: lower-limit examples;
- row 2: upper-limit examples;
- row 3: random combined training-style examples.

Each cell has a top label band naming the augmentation, then a raw clipped
image below it. Labels do not cover image pixels. Invalid pixels are black. A
red 50 percent opacity line is drawn from transformed line coordinates with
fixed screen-space thickness, and a final thin cyan vertical marker shows the
transformed control-point coordinate from `FiberStripSample.control_point_xy`
while leaving the CP pixel itself visible.

The runner writes:

- `augment_contact_sheet.jpg`;
- `augment_summary.txt`.

With `--augment-profile`, it also prints two timing tables:

- timing table with `descriptor`, `compact_geometry`, `strip_coords`,
  `coord_augmentation`, `volume_sample`, `value_augmentation`, `line_coords`,
  `to_u8`, and `overlay`, plus finer training profile keys such
  as `map_build`, `line_lookup`, `line_filter`, `coord_aug_batch`, and
  `value_aug_batch` where those paths are used;
- volume sampler stats.

## Batch Export

Without `--augment-vis`, exporting a loaded batch writes:

- one JPG per sampled strip offset;
- one valid-mask JPG per sampled strip offset;
- `contact_sheet.jpg`;
- `summary.txt` with tensor shapes, strip offsets, record/control-point indices,
  fiber paths, and control-point coordinates.

## Runner Commands

Smoke load and export a batch:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=vesuvius/src python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_2d.runner config.json --sample-index 0 --export-dir /tmp/fiber_trace_2d_batch
```

Prefetch addressed chunks:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=vesuvius/src python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_2d.runner config.json --sample-index 0 --prefetch --prefetch-samples 8
```

Export an augmentation contact sheet:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=vesuvius/src python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_2d.runner config.json --sample-index 0 --augment-vis --export-dir /tmp/fiber_trace_2d_aug
```

Add `--augment-profile` to print two timing passes for the same augment-vis
sample: pass 1 for cold/first-use costs and pass 2 for warmed costs.

Export a line-tracing inspection image:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=vesuvius/src python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_2d.runner config.json --sample-index 0 --line-trace-vis --checkpoint /path/to/current.pt --export-dir /tmp/fiber_trace_2d_trace
```

Export a trace-to-control-point inspection image and score:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=vesuvius/src python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_2d.runner config.json --sample-index 0 --trace2cp-vis --checkpoint /path/to/current.pt --export-dir /tmp/fiber_trace_2d_trace2cp
```

Export a direction-field inspection image:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=vesuvius/src python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_2d.runner config.json --sample-index 0 --dir-vis --checkpoint /path/to/current.pt --export-dir /tmp/fiber_trace_2d_dir
```

Run V0 direction training:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=vesuvius/src python -m vesuvius.neural_tracing.fiber_trace_2d.train config.json
```

For this checkout, prefer the more specific local command in
`planning/local_development.md` because it includes the VC3D Python binding path.

## Tests

Focused tests live in:

```text
vesuvius/tests/neural_tracing/test_fiber_trace_2d_loader.py
```

They cover:

- config parsing and offset generation;
- deterministic sample selection;
- fake/local-array coordinate sampling;
- side-strip coordinate generation;
- torch vectorized strip-grid equivalence to the NumPy path;
- vectorized line-coordinate augmentation behavior;
- dependency-only prefetch, cache-hit / `.empty` marker handling, and
  augmentation-envelope dependency coverage;
- runner export behavior where practical.

Run them with:

```bash
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 PYTHONPATH=vesuvius/src:. pytest -q vesuvius/tests/neural_tracing/test_fiber_trace_2d_loader.py
```

The tests are expected to use fake/local data and not require network access.

## Shared 3D accumulator pipeline

`lasagna/tiled_predict3d.py` owns accumulation for both Lasagna and Fiber 3D
inference. Multi-device runs send chunk-bounded descriptors to persistent
spawned processes; result tensors stay in the existing shared-memory slots and
accumulators stay in the rolling mmap. No tile-sized arrays are serialized
through multiprocessing queues.

`--accumulator-workers` controls process count (default `min(CPU count, 32)`;
zero selects the synchronous diagnostic baseline). Each spatial output chunk
has a deterministic worker owner and FIFO ordering. Startup and completion
logs report backend, task rate, summed work, queue wait, and wall time.

Product accumulators default to float16 and weights remain float32. The
`accumulator_add` extension uses runtime AVX-512F+F16C dispatch on matching x86
hosts and otherwise uses a portable scalar path; installation builds both this
extension and `monotone_norm`. Use `--product-accumulator-dtype float32` for the
higher-memory float32 result.

The native kernel requires contiguous X rows but supports arbitrary Y/Z
strides, unaligned rows, ring-wrap pieces, and scalar tails. It releases the
GIL, although production parallelism comes from processes rather than Python
threads.

## Local Caveats

- Normal local runner usage depends on the VC3D Python bindings. See
  `planning/local_development.md`.
- Do not run this checkout with `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1`; on the current machine it
  selects the wrong zarr/numcodecs environment.
- After changing VC3D Python bindings, update the editable installed package
  with `python -m pip install -e volume-cartographer --no-deps --break-system-packages`.
- Production remote sampling should use the VC3D blocking sampler, not the
  fallback NumPy sampler.
