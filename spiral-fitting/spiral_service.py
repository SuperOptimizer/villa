"""HTTP service for a persistent interactive Spiral fit.

The service binds to loopback by default. Non-loopback binds are explicit and
always carry bearer authentication; every client — including VC3D talking to a
process it launched itself — uses the same authenticated HTTP protocol.

Every service is bound to one dataset at startup: ``--dataset`` (inputs,
resolved once and advertised through ``/dataset``) and ``--output`` (all
generated state) are required; ``--cache`` defaults to the documented user
cache (``$XDG_CACHE_HOME/vc3d/spiral``). Both --output and --cache must
resolve outside the dataset root — the dataset holds inputs only.

The service starts ``Uninitialized``. Dataset and checkpoint discovery remain
available without importing the fitting runtime; ``POST /session/initialize``
creates the first resident session, and ``POST /session/rebuild`` replaces an
existing one.

Generated display data (previews, downloadable
checkpoints) is published as immutable, opaque artifacts and transferred
through ``/artifacts/...`` instead of host filesystem paths. Session inputs
(patches, fibers, PCL documents) can be uploaded into a dataset-scoped
editing workspace and explicitly applied or committed into the dataset.

Host filesystem paths are the service's business. A client never invents
one: a saved checkpoint is a name the service places under the session
output directory, uploads land in service-chosen staging, and everything
read back is an artifact ID. The one path a client does send — the
checkpoint to load into the resident fit — has to be one this service
advertised or wrote itself.

Long operations accept and return. A preview export costs minutes, so
``POST /session/export-preview`` starts one and answers immediately; the
client follows it through ``/session/status``, which it already polls. The
only verbs that hold a request open are the ones that are genuinely quick.

        inputs and its identity, this replaces only
        model/optimiser/scheduler/RNG state, and a checkpoint that does not

        would need; when nothing a rebuild can do would help it says
