    scaling); FitConfig performs no resolution of its own because the
    resolution policies legitimately differ per entry point (the CLI
    scales-and-splits for DDP, the interactive runtime round-trips
    checkpoint counts, the headless fit driver scales without splitting).

    Construction copies the mapping. update() mutates in place, so every
    holder of the same FitConfig (the context, its losses call sites, a
    driver that recorded it) observes run-boundary configuration changes,
    matching the former shared-wandb.config semantics.
